Carter- full name James Earl Carter Jr.- was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Son to a peanut farmer, he managed to rise from these humble beginnings and become president. He had high aspirations- he wanted to make government &quot;compassionate and competent&quot;, and help out the people of his country any way he could.

Unfortunately he is mostly remembered for causing a recession, but he had a tough gig in regards to the economic situation at the time, and without his help [[UnitedStatesOfAmerica America]] would have come out of it a lot worse off.

His foreign policies were more progressive than others that have come before or after him. Despite rubbing the powerful [[USSR]] up the wrong way with regards to his views on human rights, he still managed to pursue nuclear limitation treaties with them, open up full diplomatic relations with [[China]], and helped the peace process in the MiddleEast by way of the Camp David agreement. On a side note, his administration was the one who trained Afghani rebels to fight the [[USSR Soviet]] invasion, including a young and eager OsamaBinLaden. But hey, everyone makes mistakes!

A lot of people remember that Iran hostage crisis that consumed the last 14 months of his term, but not many people know that he (and his administration) were the ones who finally got the US hostages free- on the day JimmyCarter walked out of office, the hostages were sent home. 

Personally I think JimmyCarter was a good man, who came to power in difficult times (both internationally and internally) and did the best he, or indeed anyone, could have done.
