Their most famous song is &#x27;Little Fluffy Clouds&#x27;. They famously released a single, &#x27;The Blue Room&#x27;, which was 39 minutes long. When they appeared on TopOfThePops to promote it, instead of miming the music they simply sat and played chess.

Another famous [[TheOrb Orb]] song is &#x27;The huge ever growing pulsating brain that rules from the centre of the ultraworld&#x27;.
