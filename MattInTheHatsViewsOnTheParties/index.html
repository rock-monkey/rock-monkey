    To start with:<br />
<strong><a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a></strong><br />
Seem to be making the most sense. They&#39;re running a <a href="/PositiveCampaigning" class="internal">positive campaign</a>, they&#39;ve kept a constant view on the war in Iraq (more on that later) and they&#39;re the only party who seem to be promising that they&#39;ll increase public services by increasing your taxes. They stay out of grandstanding in the House of Commons, favouring instead to actually discuss the issues. They&#39;re ignored, by and large, in the electioneering of the other two parties.<br />
They were opposed to the war in Iraq (as I was) however they pledge that if they are elected they will bring the troops home quickly. This is not a good thing to do. The <a href="/UnitedKingdom" class="internal">UK</a> was involved in destroyiong the infrastructure ofg Iraq; they are now duty-bound to remain <em>and bear the associated costs</em> untill that infrastructure can be restored in a way of which the Iraqi people approve.<br />
Also, the last time they were in power they increased the democracy of the country: they gave women the vote.<br />
