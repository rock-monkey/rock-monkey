      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">The Sailors start leaping through the shattered window and Zanatoth looks panicked. But then he throws Ernest to the ground and shoots a bolt of negative energy straight at his mincing frame, Ernests flesh turns to cinders almost instantly and collapses into a little pile of incinerated gay. 

&quot;Right!&quot; says Zanatoth &quot;Who else wants some?&quot;

The other sailors take one look at Ernests remains and turn and flee. So much for your amazing cock-sucking ability...
