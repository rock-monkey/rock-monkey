You tell Chief Inspector Blancheflower about Father McLeary&#x27;s murder and everything you saw at the church.

&quot;Zanatoth is such a twat. I hate him. I&#x27;ll get forensics over to the church right away. Meanwhile you need to get yourself over to Aberfictitious and look for PeterHain. Here&#x27;s a return ticket. Somewhat incredibly there&#x27;s a boat that leaves the harbour every ten minutes. Don&#x27;t come back until you&#x27;ve found the Secretary of State.&quot;
