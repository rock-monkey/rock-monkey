<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">This is not a very nice page, bordering on hatred. I don't like the way you keep using the word &quot;Pretending&quot; and the phrase &quot;pointless and delusional&quot;. Maybe the sooner you realise that not everyone is like you, the sooner you might respect other peoples beliefs. I am not aware of any werewolves trying to convince you that you are also one, but you just don't know it yet... Also, the point isn't just &quot;to get laid&quot;. Please try and be more open-minded</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Now that's interesting - if anyone logs on using a UWA workstation PC, it seems to become the login for everyone else. Is RockMonkey detecting the correct IP address?</div><cite><a href="/meudwy.aber.ac.uk">meudwy.aber.ac.uk</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">re: to get laid - it may not be the point, but it shows that even if it *were* just pretend (I'm not saying it is, I'm not saying it isn't *wink*), it would still have value (please refer to version of the page that was current at the time the first comment was made if you *really* want to continue this... but as it's changed now there shouldn't be any need to, si?)</div><cite><a href="/82-33-196-204.cable.ubr01.hawk.blueyonder.co.uk">82-33-196-204.cable.ubr01.hawk.blueyonder.co.uk</a></cite></blockquote></div>
