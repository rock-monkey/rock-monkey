      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">TheDevTeamThinkOfEverything, usually abbreviated to TDTTOE, is a phrase used by accomplished NetHack players who are surprised for the millionth time that the development team &#x2F;&#x2F;really do&#x2F;&#x2F; think of anything. For example, if you eat from a can which turns out to get your hands greasy... but you&#x27;re currently polymorphed into a creature of a kind that &#x2F;&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t have hands&#x2F;&#x2F;, the game (correctly) adapts the sentence to fit (e.g. &quot;Your paws become greasy.&quot;, &quot;You now have greasy tentacles.&quot;). And if you look into a mirror while hallucinating and polymorphed into a creature with a sight-based petrification ability, you become kind-of entrapped in the gaze of the beast in the mirror, but then it goes away... and... it&#x27;s just an immensely clever game.
