[[Worms]] are the wiggliest of all [[Animals]]. They live in [[Soil soil]] and are the favourite animal for [[Children]] to torture when bored in [[Garden Gardens]], just after [[Slugs]].

If you chop a [[Worms Worm]] in two rather than dying it will become two [[Worms]]*, which will then continue to be alive and do wiggly things. This brings about the question of whether [[Worms]] have a [[Soul]] and if so, what it would be like. If one half of a severed worm was [[Sin sinful]], and the other good would it go half to [[Hell]] and half to [[Heaven]]? Or it, say, spend a week in one then a week in another? If so [[Worms]] may be uniquely placed in the AnimalKingdom to comment on the nature of [[Spirituality]]. Unfortunately a)they cannot speak and b)they&#x27;re probably in no mood to further [[Humans Human]] knowledge as they keep getting chopped by [[Children]] with spades.

* NB: this does not work with [[Ducks]]
Also; it&#x27;s not true. Assuming no fatal damage occurs, the half with the vital organs (look the the lump in particularly fat worms) has some chance to survive and regrow - but it&#x27;s not a great chance. The remaining half will die. In actual fact, the odds of the worms survival are limited at best if you cut it in half, so please don&#x27;t do this. [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;dna&#x2F;h2g2&#x2F;A531983 More info on the &#x27;half worm myth&#x27; from the BBC]].
Plus; it certainly doesn&#x27;t work if you cut it lengthways.

Did you mean to look for RockMonkey info on the film [[Worm]]?
