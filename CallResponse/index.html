This can be spoken, or the second singer can even be replaced by a riff. A variation is &quot;Question &amp; Answer&quot;, where the two lines take on special meaning

Example includes:

DavidBowie - TheLaughingGnome

&quot;Haven&#x27;t you got an &#x27;ome to go to?&quot;
&#x27;No, we&#x27;re gnomads&#x27;
&quot;Didn&#x27;t they teach you to get your hair cut at school? You look like a rolling gnome.&quot;
&#x27;No, not at the London School of Ecognomics&#x27;

&#x2F;&#x2F;(This isn&#x27;t strictly Call and Response but we&#x27;ll let it go...)&#x2F;&#x2F;

TheBeatles were quite fond of this. As are [[ASSA]].
