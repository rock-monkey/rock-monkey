=== The Man ===

StephenHawking is one of the world&#x27;s leading TheoreticalPhysicists. But you already knew that, because you [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stephen_Hawking read about him on Wikipedia]].

=== The Method ===

StephenHawking is the universal constant by which [[ClaireMelton Claire]] argues that it is possible to determine the difference between a game and a sport: that great mystery. This can be determined, [[ClaireMelton Claire]] claims, by working out whether or not StephenHawking can participate in it or not.

If he can participate, it is a game; if he cannot, it is a sport. In order to attempt to prove her wrong, RockMonkey hosts two lists:

== GamesStephenHawkingCantPlay ==
== SportsStephenHawkingCanPlay ==

In that case why are the OlympicGames so called? (Decides this is final evidence that [[ClaireMelton Claire]] is wrong.) - AndyKeohane

He is also perfectly capable of playing TheGame

Please feel free to add to these lists.
