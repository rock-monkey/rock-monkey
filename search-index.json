This list is easily accessed from the Wiki's top navigation bar. (Categories).\n~- Each category has a WikiName name of the form \"\"CategoryName\"\" for example CategoryWiki etc. (see list of maincategories above)\n~- Pages can belong to zero or more categories. Including a page in a category is done by simply mentioning the \"\"CategoryName\"\" on the page (by convention at the very end of the page).\n~- The system allows to build hierarchies of categories by referring to the parent category in the subcategory page. The parent category page will then automatically include the subcategory page in its list.\n~- A special kind of category is **\"\"Category Users\"\"** (//without the space//) to group the userpages, so your Wiki homepage should include it at the end to be included in the category-driven userlist.\n~- New categories can be created (think very hard before doing this though, we don't need too much of them) by creating a \"\"CategoryName\"\" page, including \"\"{{Category}}\"\" in it and placing it in the **Category Category** (//without the space//) category (for a main category or another parent category in case you want to create a subcategory).\n\n**Please help to keep this place organized by including the relevant categories in new and existing pages !**\n\n**Notes:** \n~- The above bold items above //include spaces// to prevent this page from showing up in the mentioned categories. This page only belongs in CategoryWiki (which can be safely mentioned) after all !\n~- In order to avoid accidental miscategorization you should **avoid** mentioning a non-related \"\"CategoryName\"\" on a page. This is a side-effect of how the categorizing system works: it's based on a textsearch and is not restricted to the footer convention.\n~- Don't be put of by the name of this page (WikiCategory) which is a logical name (it's about the Wiki and explains Category) but doesn't have any special role in the Categorizing system.\n~- To end with this is the **standard convention** to include the categories (both the wiki code and the result):\n\n%%==Categories==\nCategoryWiki%%\n\n==Categories==\nCategoryWiki"},{"tag":"FormattingRules","body":"=== The Wiki Formatting Guide ===\n\nAnything between 2 sets of double-quotes is ignored and presented exactly as typed (that means the formatting commands below are ignored whenever surrounded by double double-quotes.)\n\nOnce you've read through this, test your formatting skills in the SandBox.\n----\n===Basic formatting:===\n\n\t\"\"**I'm bold text!**\"\"\n\t**I'm bold text!**\n\n\t\"\"//I'm italic text!//\"\"\n\t//I'm italic text!//\n\n\t\"\"And I'm __underlined__!\"\"\n\tAnd I'm __underlined__!\n\n\t\"\"##monospace text##\"\"\n\t##monospace text##\n\n\t\"\"''highlight text''\"\" (using 2 single-quotes)\n\t''highlight text''\n\n\t\"\"++Strike through text++\"\"\n\t++Strike through text++\n\n\t\"\"Press #%ANY KEY#%\"\"\n\tPress #%ANY KEY#%\n\n\t\"\"@@Center text@@\"\"\n\t@@Center text@@\n\n ===Headers:===\n\t\"\"====== Really big header ======\"\"\n\t====== Really big header ======\n\t\n\t\"\"===== Rather big header =====\"\"\n\t===== Rather big header =====\n\t\n\t\"\"==== Medium header ====\"\" \n\t==== Medium header ====\n\t\n\t\"\"=== Not-so-big header ===\"\" \n\t=== Not-so-big header ===\n\t\n\t\"\"== Smallish header ==\"\" \n\t== Smallish header ==\n\n===Horizontal separator:===\n\t\"\"----\"\"\n----\n\n===Forced line break:===\n\t\"\"---\"\"\n---\n----\n===Lists / Indents:===\nIndent text using **4** spaces (which will auto-convert into tabs) or using \"~\".

He grew up in a God-fearing Texan family and after developing a gift for stand-up at school he would sneek out of his room at night to perform in his local comedy club.\n\nAfter dropping out of college BillHicks moved to LosAngeles to begin his career but soon left for NewYork, partially due to the fact that LosAngeles weather did not agree with his dress sense. Whilst Hicks would do spectacularly in a club atmosphere his extreme opposition to commercialism kept him out of the [[TV]] scene by not only the reluctance of [[TV]] executives to pick him up but with his vehement distaste to his being censored or controlled in any way.\n\nA comedy special that he did do for [[TV]] in America was broadcast on ChannelFour over here unedited leading to a much more informed opinion of his act (viewers of Hicks' [[TV]] special in America were shocked by his vulgarity and eviscerative dealing of hecklers when they saw him live) and hence a distinct cult following. This British cult following was great enough to warrant a limited tour.\n\nThe majority of Hicks' act centred around satirising and criticising the government, media and just about any institution larger than an individual with occasional, improvised flights of fancy. He was a distinctive voice in favour of drug taking, yet another factor that kept him from mainstream comedy. He stressed that drugs had positive effects as well as negative and highlighted the media bias in only covering the negative.\n\nTowards the end of his unfortunately and unnaturally short career his act became more refined and more pointed in it's satire and relied less upon vulgarity and irreverence however he suffered a massive blow to his confidence when a set that he performmed for his friend [[DavidLettermansLateShow]] was unbroadcast for vague reasons by uncertain persons. He felt betrayed by a friend, doubly so in that he couldn't find out who had called for the censure. He refused to perform again for the show, despite a number of invitations, and went back to comedy clubs. During what was to be his last performance he simply stopped in the middle of hsi set, called his agent to the front and said that he was done. Few knew what he knew.\n\nHe died of pancreatic cancer on the 26th of February 1996."},{"tag":"MutuallyExclusive","body":"Things that can't exist together some are listed below;\n\n~- The UltimateAnswer and The UltimateQuestion."},{"tag":"TheUniverse","body":"This doesn't actually exist its all in your mind, or my mind, or prehaps the mind it exists in doesn't really exist itself its just a figment of something else's imagination.\n\n----\nSee also OurUniverse (what's the difference)"},{"tag":"WorldDominationPlans","body":"MINE\n\n----\nFor more information contact the current president of the world domination society [[BrynSalisbury Bryn]]"},{"tag":"ThePointlessPage","body":"Wibble."},{"tag":"RobinVarleyQuotes","body":"//RobinVarley holds up a copy of 'Front'//\nRuthVarley: Believe it or not, I have seen breasts before.\nRobinVarley: Really?

The boys - Paul, Andy and JTA - want to cross the bridge from left to right. The girls - Suz, Ruth and Liz - want to cross the bridge from right to left. There are spaces for eight people on the bridge, and these six start at the two ends (leaving two empty spaces in the middle).\n\nClicking on a person will cause them to try to move accross the bridge. The boys will always try to move to the right, and the girls will always try to move to the left. There are two kinds of moves:\n\n~- If the space in front of the person moving is //unoccupied//, the person will slide forwards into that space.\n~- If the space in front of the person moving is //occupied// by a member of the opposite sex, the person will try to \"leapfrog\" over them into an unoccupied space behind them. People cannot leapfrog over people of the same gender, and they cannot leapfrog if there is no free space behind the person they are leap-frogging over.\n\nIf there is no free space to move to, a person cannot move.\n\nPaul, Andy, JTA, Suz, Ruth and Liz are all very stubborn (especially Paul) and will not take a step backwards along the bridge for any reason (the boys will always only move to the right, and the girls will always only move to the left).

If this happens to you (and when you click on a person to cause them to move you find yourself on an 'Edit' page), please leave a note on **this** page so that it can be found and corrected (please do **not** define them yourselves as this makes finding them more difficult!).\n\nI've just (5th November 2004) added a few more 'missing' pages. I apologise again for the problems with this game, but sadly [[MattInTheHat somebody]] started playing it and 'filling in' pages before they were finished, thereby causing dozens of pages to have to be re-done by hand. We're getting there. The puzzle can now be 'solved' by a vast number of routes.\n\nPlease feel free to add \"flavour\" comments to describe the //positions// the people on the bridge find themselves in, underneath the pictures.

Today, the structure is entirely ruined, a forlorn jumble of towers and foundations most striking for their proximity to the pounding waters of the temperamental sea. For centuries before the castle's construction, the Welsh had proved quarrelsome, wanting their own Prince of Wales and demanding their independence. In the middle of the 13th century, Henry III attempted to appease the Welsh. When he officially named Llywelyn ap Gruffydd as the Prince of Wales, the English king recognized the Welshman's power and charisma. However, the title did not quiet the native Welsh prince, and in the early 1270's, Llywelyn refused to pay homage to the new king, Edward I. By 1276, Edward lost his patience with what he considered as insolence by Llywelyn and his people, and began his first campaign against the Welsh. \n\nIn 1277, King Edward I ordered the construction of several formidable castles. They included Flint, Rhuddlan, Builth, and Aberystwyth. All these castles have survived and are accessible to the public. Of these four castles, two led the way into the future of castle construction. Designed as concentric fortresses, Rhuddlan and Aberystwyth Castles were innovative structures composed of rings of defenses, walls-within-walls, which allowed guards to defend their stronghold from several heights without firing upon their own men. Of the two castles, Aberystwyth is the most ruined, but in its heyday, the castle was every bit as intimidating and secure as its cousin in North East Wales.//\n\nSeveral paths lead down from this old fort.\n----\n**What next?**\n~- [[TromaNight013 Walk towards town]]\n~- [[TromaNight041 Walk towards the pier]]\n~- [[TromaNight049 Walk towards South Beach]]"},{"tag":"TromaNight049","body":"==== TromaNightAdventure ====\n=== Promenade South ===\n----\n{{image class=\"center\" alt=\"South Beach\" url=\"/TromaNightAdventure/beachs2.jpg\"}}\n\nYou find yourself on the Southern part of [[AberystwythTown Aberystwyth]]'s coastline - the stretch of the promenade that runs parallel to South Beach.

You don't //have// to get all of the TromaNight stars to TromaNight - three (of your choice) will do... but each extra star is worth extra points, and some of the stars have special abilities of thier own which might help you in your quest.\n\n~- **Multiple Solutions**: Each different subquest may have different ways to solve it... and some do not have to be solved at all. Of these, different solutions may provide different numbers of points, but any solution can lead to completion of the game.\n\n~- **Adaptive**: The game responds differently depending on the way in which you go about things. If you take a particular two people to a particular place, you may get a special message (for example, take JonAtkinson and MisterJTA to Wetherspoons and they'll chat about the age of the people being served).\n\n~- **Continuously Growing**: The game will continue to be enhanced over the coming months, adding new features, new ways to win, and other goodies.\n\n----\n\n==== Version History & Bugs ====\n\nOver the initial period of the launch of the game, it's expected that many minor changes (for example, **v0.915**, which basically just improves the conversation skills of AndyKeohane) will be made. Major changes will be highlighted, in order that you can more easily find them - there's no need to play through the game again just because a minor change has been made: wait for a major change!\n\n=== Version History ===\n**v1.06** - 11:46, 11th December 2004 - Resized unbelievabley large images to a more believable size.\n\n**v1.05** - 10:56, 10th December 2004 - completed 'empty bullets' fixes. Game now looks cleaner on [[InternetExplorer IE]]/[[MozillaFirefox Firefox]] and doesn't give players an advantage by letting them see bullet points for options that don't yet exist.\n\n**v1.03** - 15:23, 9th December 2004 - fixed 'manhole opener WikiGameToolkit Error' (was caused by typo during 'empty bullets' fixes); thanks [[MisterJTA JTA]] for finding that one! Also fixed 'empty bullets' 218-231.\n\n**v1.02** - 12:26, 9th December 2004 - fixed 'empty bullets' problem on scenes 123-217. Fixed bug in collection and use of handbag that would typically prevent players from getting the Arty Film. Keep reporting bugs back to me!\n\n**v1.01** - 11:35, 9th December 2004 - fixed 'empty bullets' problem on scenes 000-122. Improved conversation with man-with-bucket-on-head (now able to 'free' him at any point in the conversation, not just at the beginning). Improved HollywoodPizza (now not possible to order Pizza With Vegetables if you already have one).\n\n++**v1.0** - MAJOR CHANGE++ - 16:01, 7th December 2004 - now possible to get **full score** (175 points). Arty Film added, made RuthVarley useful, etc.\n\n**v0.92** - 16:35, 6th December 2004 - added pictures to the nature reserve, national library, parts of campus and bits of the prom and beach.\n\n**v0.917** - 13:18, 6th December 2004 - if you 'cheat death' by pressing the back button, the game will deduct 50 points from you if you eventually win.\n\n**v0.916** - 11:26, 6th December 2004 - you can now ask DanHuntley for a list of some of the 'extra challenges' you can do for extra points, and some general tips.\n\n**v0.915** - 10:59, 6th December 2004 - if you have AndyKeohane and you're walking along the beach, you can repeatedly stop to ask him \"What kind of rock is that?\".\n\n**v0.91** - 17:16, 5th December 2004 - minor bug fixes: [[PaulMann Paul]]'s conversation is cleaned up, formatting is fixed, typo is corrected.\n\n**v0.9** - 14:20, 5th December 2004 - first release. Not possible (yet) to get \"Arty Film\", but still winnable and still possible to get 165/175 points. Not fully tested - please report bugs by adding to the list, below. Hints not written yet. Conversations with RuthVarley and PaulMann need fleshing out. Feedback welcome.\n\n=== Known Bugs ===\nPlease report bugs below:\n\n~- Typo during conversation with Paul (capital B where there shouldn't 'be' one)\n\n== Fixed Bugs ==\n~- Page 126 - \"...Room Room...\" insead of Rock Room - //Minor typo, fixed 2004-12-05 17:02//\n~- L'Escala has some funkiness - //Minor formatting issue, fixed 2004-12-05 17:03//\n~- The conversation with Paul is... even more cryptic than you intended. - //Logic quirks in the conversation, fixed 2004-12-05 17:16//\n~- Page 204 - 'Never mind' link goes to the wrong place (same also discovered to occur \"Outside Somerfield\") - //Fixed link, 2004-12-05 22:09//\n~- Not possible to get Arty Film - //Fixed as part of v1.0//\n~- Still not possible to get Arty Film (handbag problem) - //Fixed as part of v1.02//\n~- 005 throws up a Wiki Game Toolkit error\" where it used to let you take the manhole cover opener\n~- IE and Mozilla incorrectly render the 'empty' bulleted lists, showing players the existance of options that they don't yet have access to!

For example you will collect a number of 'Vital Clues' which you can't drop or give to people, but which you can discuss with people. \n\nAnother example: one of the first things you will need to get in the game is 'Sailors Trust' which will then change any conversations you may have with sailors.\n\n==Stuck?==\n\nIf you get stuck, try talking to some people you haven't talked to for a while. They may have something new to say to you.\n\nFor actual physical objects, each one has a use.

[[Goblins]] are evil creatures who delight in enslaving, torturing and killing [[human humans]], [[Dwarfs]] and [[Elves]]. Some still dwell in primitive villages in the wilderness, but most now serve alongside [[Orcs]], [[Ogres]] and [[Trolls]] in the inhuman armies of Chaos. Like most of their cousins they prefer to live underground, away from sunlight which annoys them with its brightness.\n\n[[Goblins]] are typically armed with swords, small axes or throwing-daggers. They also like making cruel traps for unwary creatures to stumble into. These can include deep pits full of poison-tipped spikes, barbed man-traps and a number of other nasty devices. Each tribe of [[Goblins]] will be led by a stronger warrior at the front of any attack.\n\nMarsh [[Goblins]] are similar to common [[Goblins]], but with a few notable differences. They are thinner, with green-tinted, almost scaly skins, and their hands and feet are webbed for swimming. They spend most of their time skulking in the mud and reeds of their swampland homes. Marsh [[Goblins]] like [[human humans]] even less than their land-based relatives do, and they delight, for example, in typing a captive to a board and leaving him for giant leeches to drain slowly of blood...\n\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"},{"tag":"BasiliskLizard","body":"\"From a distance it could be a large lizard, two metres from snout to tail, and coloured a mottled sandy-brown. Those innocent or foolish adventurers who want to get closer will notice that the creature's head is rather bird-like and is tilted from to side to side as it tentatively sniffs the air. For one brief moment, they may take in the fact that its eyes are large and yellow, almost like a frog's, before the gaze of the Basilisk turns them to stone.\n\nThese legendary beasts kill by catching the gaze of their victim and petrifying them. An opponent needs to [be extremely lucky] in order to cover his eyes in time and avert his gaze. Attacking the creature by slashing a weapon at it without looking is just as perilous, for its poisonous breath will kill instantly! However, a Basilisk's gaze is as harmful to itself as it is to other living things. Should it catch sight of its eyes in a mirror or some other reflective device, it will turn itself to stone, hardening from living flesh to dead rock in an instant\n\nHabitat: Deserts, plains, ruins\"\n\nSee?

Also known as the King of Serpents in some lands, it is a curious amalgam of a number of different creatures. It has the head and body of a large cockerel, the large leathery wings of a bat, and a long, snake-like tail. It can fly short distances, but will usually strut about on the ground flapping its wings. It is carnivorous, and will fearlessly attack any large creature it encounters.\n\nIn an attack a Cockatrice will attempt to peck with its beak... However, the beast also has poisonous breath, which will paralyse anything it comes into contact with. If the Cockatrice hits with its beak, damage is normally dependent on a 2D6 die roll, or a 1 in 12 chance of:\n\nHit in the brain - instant death\nHit on sword-arm - must use other arm to attack. Lose skill\nHit on back - difficult to move. Lose skill\nHit on left leg - can only limp. Lose skill\nHit on second-arm - cannot use arm. Lose minor skill point\nNo penalty\nHit in eye - 3D vision gone. Lose skill\nHit on right leg - can only limp. Lose skill\nHit on both legs - cannot move. Lose skill\nHit on both arms - cannot use arms to fight, carry items etc...\nHit in heart - instant death\n\nAnyone caught by the Cockatrice's breath has a chance of dodging the worst of it [if they are lucky]. Like the Basilisk, to which it is distantly related, the Cockatrice has a major weakness. If it catches sight of its reflection in a mirror or some other reflective surface it will die. Persuading a hungry Cockatrice to stop and look into a mirror requires [the adventurer to be very lucky indeed]. If he fails, the Cockatrice may decide to attack while he is occupied, scoring an *automatic hit*. No one is sure why the thing can be killed in this way, but this knowledge has proved useful to a number of lucky adventurers throughout the years\"\n\nNot exactly what NetHack seems to have in mind when it talks about Cockatrices, but there you go....\n\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"},{"tag":"Hamakei","body":"Perched in towers hidden in the desert wastelands, the Hamakei are the last remnants of a past, more sorcerous age. Centuries old, these brittle, withered humanoids have vulture-like heads, and are usually swathed in masses of fine robes. They are warlocks and sages, kept alive well beyond their normal span by arcane spells and magical artefacts. Their powers are wide, gleaned from decades of research in forgotten libraries, but they use them only rarely. The Hamakei see themselves as scholars and observers, and will rarely be drawn into the petty conflicts of mortal men. Their lust is only for knowledge, and their advice can sometimes be traded for an old scroll or ancient device.\n\nAs crotchety as an ancient owl, they can be extremely temperamental and absent-minded, but will swiftly turn from doddering fool to wily fox at the mention of lost knowledge. Occasionally a Hamakei will set out into the world of men, wandering from settlement to settlement in search of any snippet it can overhear. Some are interested in the progress of this younger age and will seek out human sorcerers, to see how much of the lost arts they have rediscovered.\n\nIf encountered away from its home, a Hamakei will be dressed in inconspicuous travelling-clothes, and will lean on a long staff to help it along. The staff will usually be magical and may have spells bound into it. In the event of a drirect attack, a Hamakei can call upon many spells to ward off attackers, including magical dusts that blind or charm an opponent, and jets and walls of flame and ice. If such attacks fail to repel an aggressor, it will be forced to use its staff to defend itself as best it can.\n\nTheir towers will usually be defended by a host of magical traps, to keep intruders away. Their treasure-hoards will be large, consisting for the most part of hundreds of unintelligible and very, very ancient books, scrolls and papers, with a few strange artefacts scattered among them. Any sage worth his salt would pay dearly for even a glimpse of such treasures, though they may appear all but worthless to an adventurer.\n\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"},{"tag":"WereWolf","body":"WereWolf.\n\n****HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA**** - JonAtkinson and AndyKeohane\n\n----\nI still don't see what's funny about dating a LycanthropicPerson... - PaulMann\n\nNope, nor me... but it seems to bring great pleasure to [[JonAtkinson Jon]] and [[AndyKeohane Andy]]... hmm... - DanHuntley\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures (Well, under certain conditions)]]"},{"tag":"UltimateQuestion","body":"This can not exist in the same [[Universe]] as the UltimateAnswer."},{"tag":"AberWiki","body":"AberWiki is another Aberystwyth Wiki, mainly populated by ComputerScienceStudents.\n\nIt's not as good as RockMonkey.

Now, search engines have been asked to ignore these old pages. This change will take several weeks to start having an effect.\n\n~- 3rd March 2005: Added a spam blocker which tests for the sudden addition of a large number of external links to a WikiPage, and prevents it. If this trips anybody over making a legitimate change, they should leave a note on this page. This spam blocker would prevent all of the WikiSpam we've seen on RockMonkey to date.\n----\n=== Pages Affected ===\n\nNone at present, but is becoming an increasing problem.\n----\n=== WikiSpam Cleaning ===\nHow to help in the fight against spam on our wiki:\n\n~- Check the RecentChanges page regularly, and if you find spam, act!\n~- WikiSpam typically looks like a long series of off-site word links, usually at the bottom of a page, but can take other forms, too.\n~- Change the page immediately, removing the WikiSpam. Leave a note on your edit (in the small text box at the bottom of the edit page) stating that you \"removed WikiSpam\" (this means that people using the RecentChanges list won't feel the need to look at a page that hasn't actually been changed, and helps us keep track of how bad the problem becomes).\n~- If you find WikiSpam that for some reason you can't change (no time, wierd permissions, etc.), edit this page and put the name of the affected page in the Pages Affected list, above."},{"tag":"Bureaucracy","body":"Dictionary.com offers one defintion of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] as //\"An administrative system in which the need or inclination to follow rigid or complex procedures impedes effective action.\"//\n\nRestlessBoy feels that [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] is one of the biggest inadvertant evils in the [[World world]] today, for these reasons:\n~- It impedes [[Progress progress]] and gives power to people who want to get their way by bullying or boring others into submission. Or by making it too complicated for them to work against the system to better their own individual situation. This is often unintentional which makes it worse.\n~- It values systems above individual judgement. \n~- It seeks to protect the wider public from potential flaws or errors of those in power but at the same time constrains those in power from making dynamic or innovative decisions with any speed, or sometimes entirely.\n~- The very individuals who make the rules can more often than not hold up their hands and say 'There's nothing I can do, those are the rules'.\n~- People spend ages making up the rules, often allowing things to pass them by. They invariably later find the rules to be deficient in some way.\n~- It allows individual cases of suffering caused by the rules to be written off as [[Statistics statistics]]. \n~- In terms of government bureaucracy, entire groups of people can be left suffering whilst huge groups of CivilServants/[[Bureaucrats]] discuss what can be done about their plight.\n\nAn alternative is to elect people who are trustworthy, adept, knowledgable, and with the right priorities to a positions of power. Make sure their actions are open to scrutiny and that they can legally and personally be held accountable for their consequences. Then let them get it on with it. \n\nThe fact that [[Idiots TheGeneralPublic]] has lost faith in this idea is what allows [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] to thrive and perpepuates further shitness. Because [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] is given a human face means [[Wankers TheGeneralPublic]] can ascribe blame to that person for the results of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]]'s endeavour. This leads them to further believe that it is the person, not the system, that is at fault and call for further systems. \n\n//\"[[Capitalism]] doesn't work, [[Communism]] doesn't work, what we need is socialism under a benevolent dictator.

These tall humanoids live about twice as long as humans, whom they tend to look down on as children. All elves are thin beings, with large ears and slanting eyes. They seem more graceful than [[Human humans]], and far more intelligent somehow. They are fearless warriors, particularly expert with longbows. There are a number of different Elven races, each sharing a common heritage, but very different from the others.\n\nBlack elves were originally renegades from the evil kingdoms of the Dark Elves, to whom they are related. They abandoned the forests with them, and helped build their underground kingdoms, but grew more and more horrified as the dark elves dabbled in fearful magic and demonism. So they fled the cavern cities and setlled in isolated areas away from other elven races, where they now live squalid lives alongside [[Orcs orcs]], [[Goblins goblins]] and other inhuman races. Like all elves they are tall and thin. Their skin is somewhere between grey and black in colour, their slanted eyes yellow and catlike. They dress in shabby clothes of outlandish design, and sometimes decorate themselves in a similar fashion, with bizarrely cropped hair and painted patterns on their faces. Their favourite weapons are longbows, but they have also become skilled with spears and curved swords. Some black elves are nomads, travelling the plains in caravans to trade their wares in isolated settlements. Others live in small villages themselves, hunting and farming on the ppor land. All black elves are distrustful of other beings. They will attack other types of elves on sight, but other beings will be treated neutrally, if not in a friendly way. They have no love for strangers, and are not averse to waylaying them for gold.\n\nIn the times before the rise of human civilization, the different elven races went their separate ways across the world. The taint of evil had split them into two factions. In the wars that followed, the side of good won, however, and their opponents were forced to retreat beneath the earth, leaving the forests to the Wood Elves. In time all memory of these evil tribes was forgotten. In the darkness of their subterranean world, though, the dark elves grew strong again, and their civilization developed. Over the centuries their physical form changed, and they became very thin and gaunt, with midnight-black skin and green eyes. Their mind developed too, and they became more and more evil. Their sorcerers began to rule them, and their culture became decadent with slaves, demon worship and grisly magical rituals, for they had perverted the ancient elven magic to their own ends. They have an inbuilt hatred of all surface-dwellers, and small bands of dark elves continue to raid isolated aras, burning and looting whatever they find. When on the surface they shield themselves under large, black, hooded cloaks. Below ground, however, dark elves look very different, dressing in bizarre ornate clothes and decorating their hair and bodies with strange patterns and colours. Their favourite weapons are still bows, though in the confines below they prefer long serrated knives, fashioned in strange metals and with powerful mkagic bound into them in jagged ancient runes. Despite their hatred of the surface world, the dark elves know they could never return to live there. But their hatred continues unabated, and their raiding parties will always stalk the [[Earth earth]], killing or abducting any they meet.\n\nNot all good elves dwell in the lowland forests. Higher up, on the hills and mountainsides, Mountain Elves hunt in the snowy evergreen forests. They look very similar to wood elves, though they are shorter and not quite so thin. They dress in warm hides and furs, typically brown or white, and carry bows and long hunting-knives. They are excellent shots, and can hit any target 5 times in 6. They live off deer, rabbits and other woodland creatures, though they are careful to take only what they need. Mountain elves make their homes in small huts perched high up in trees, which offer protection from the ravages of snow wolves and other dangerous predators. Mountain delves are peaceful, rather shy beings, who do not concern themselves with the affairs of the younger races. They are wary of strangers, but will be helpful if treated with respect. If they are attacked, they will not hesitate to kill their opponents with a deadly volley of arrows.\n\nThe most common of all the elven races are the Wood Elves, who may be encountered in any large forest. They are friendly, peaceful beings who love nature and spend much of their time caring for plants, trees and the other denizens of the forests. They don't much care for [[Dwarfs dwarfs]], because they are unable to understand how they can shut themselves away from the beautiful surface world. Wood elves loathe [[Orcs orcs]], [[Trolls trolls]] and the other inhuman races for their ugliness and their insistence on burning down forests and murdering innocent creatures out of hand. As far as [[Human humans]] are concerned, they are undecided. They know that some are their allies in fighting the forces of evil, while others are in league with the [[orcs]] and their foul ilk. If adventurers are friendly and respectful, wood elves will give them all the help they need. If they prove violent and destructive, they will not be allowed to take another step into the elves' domain. Wood elves prefer to dress in soft green clothes which allow them to blend with their overgrown surroundings. They are skilled in all the woodland crafts, and can track their prey in complete silence until they wish to strike. They are superb bowmen, hitting 5 times in every 6. In combat they will also use shortswords to great effect. They dwell in large hidden villages protected both by overgrown vegetation and powerful magic. The wood elves ensure that only those they trust can find their villages. All others who seek them will become lost and wander around without ever getting near them. In their villages the elves are ruled over by proud nobles, both great warriors and spell-casters, who rule fairly and justly over all the creatures of the forest.\n\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]\nDo not confuse with: [[Elvis]]"},{"tag":"Elvis","body":"====Elvis====\n\n{{image url=\"http://www.americanroyalarts.com/library/joe_petruccio/jp_comeback.jpg\" class=\"center\"}}\n\n===From 'TheDayToday':===\n\n//Referring to a death-row inmate who wishes to be executed dressed as Elvis on an electric toilet seat..//\n\nBarbara Wintergreen : //Don't you worry that this is how people will see the King from now on?//\nAlvin Steele: //You could be right there.//\nBarbara Wintergreen: //But won't that destroy his reputation?//\nAlivn Steele: //No ma'am, the King did that himself by dying on the John in a big nappy.//\n----\nDo not confuse with: [[Elves]]"},{"tag":"LearnDirect","body":"Courses that teach people how to do simple things on computers\nOr teach people how to read [[Books]]\nOr do [[Sums sums]]\n\nDo a course the [[Northamptonshire]] LibRaries and make StrokeyAdam's job easier"},{"tag":"BuyThingsWhyNot03","body":"Then come and [[TheRestlessCorporation Work For Me!]]\n\nWork every hour [[God]] sends for a wage that is not quite enough for you to rise above your station but not quite enough for you to starve to death!\n\nIn addition you may then be able to BuyThings!

To assist in the creation of WikiGames, [[DanHuntley I]] have created this page.\n\n----\n==== 1. General Design Tips ====\n\n~- When designing a wiki-based adventure (or other) game, use the WantedPages list to determine which links you have not yet 'finished'. When testing a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] on behalf of the creator, do not 'create' missing pages (unless invited to), because this makes it very difficult for them to find and 'fix' missing pages.\n\n~- Sketch out a design on paper before you start: outline what the game will be about and how it will be fulfilled.\n\n~- Avoid making 'GameOver' situations where it is not possible that the player will have been given any warning beforehand. (RestlessBoy - this is no fun)\n----\n==== 2. Advanced [[WikiGames WikiGame]] Tools ====\n=== 2.1. Inventory Management ===\n~- Thanks to a plug-in I've written, it is now possible to 'give' your players 'items' which they will carry around until relieved of them.\n\n~- To give your player an item, simply include a line like %%{{InvPickup item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\"}}%% in your code. If the player does not already have the item, they will be told that they now do, and it will be added to their inventory (shown at the side of the window). To see this in action, and to examine a code example, visit WikiGameToolkitDemoPickup and WikiGameToolkitDemoPickup2.\n\n~- To force your player to lose an item, simple add a line like %%{{InvDrop item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\"}}%% in your code. If the player has the item, they will be informed that they no longer have it and it will be removed from their inventory. To see this working, visit WikiGameToolkitDemoDrop and WikiGameToolkitDemoDrop2.\n\n~- To show a link only if a player has a certain item or at least one of a number of items, use: %%{{InvHasOne item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoEatPorridge\" text=\"Eat the porridge\"}}%% For more complex examples of usage, see WikiGameToolkitDemoHasOne.\n\n~- To show a link only if a player **does not** has a certain item or at least one of a number of items, use: %%{{InvHasNone item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoGoHungry\" text=\"Wish that you had some porridge?\"}}%% For more complex examples of usage, see WikiGameToolkitDemoHasNone.\n\n~- To show a link only if a player has **all** of the items in a set, use: %%{{InvHasAll item=\"Bowl Of Porridge/Wooden Spoon\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoEatPorridgeWithSpoon\" text=\"Eat the porridge with the spoon\"}}%% This works a lot like \"\"InvHasOne\"\", but the link is only shown if the player has **every** item in the slash-separated list.\n\n~- **Do not** make a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] in which it is possible to entirely 'get stuck' if you do not have a certain item. Death and other 'GameOver' conditions are fine, but please include a 'Try Again' link back to the front page of your game.\n\n~- Remember to add lines to the front page of your game to force your players to 'drop' all of the items that feature in your game, //before// they start, otherwise they'll be able to cheat very easily. Cheating is still possible - as in any [[WikiGames WikiGame]] - but if you follow these guidelines then it can't be done 'accidently'.\n----\n=== 2.2. Tokens ===\nTokens are a kind of semi-persistent variable: a named token that can be assigned a value that can be retrieved later. They can basically be used for all the same things as objects (above) can be used for, but also a lot more, too.\n\n~- To set a token, use the following syntax: %%{{SetToken token=\"myTokenName\" value=\"fred\"}}%% This will set the value of the token \"myTokenName\" to \"fred\". You can store pretty much any kind of data in a token, but the thing they're most useful for storing is numbers.\n\n~- To display the value of a token, use: %%{{GetToken token=\"myTokenName\"}}%% If the previous code had been executed, this would output the word \"fred\" to the screen.\n\n~- If you've put a numerical value into a token, you can do simple mathematical operations upon it. This code will increment the value of the \"myValue\" token by 5: %%{{SetToken token=\"myValue\" value=\"+5\"}}%% And the following code will decrement it by 3: %%{{SetToken token=\"myValue\" value=\"-5\"}}%% See the code that manages the scoring mechanism in WikiScissorsStonePaper an example of this.\n\n~- You can also use SetToken to generate random numbers: %%{{SetToken token=\"diceRoll\" value=\"random(1,6)\"}}%% The code shown above will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) and put it into the token called \"myValue\". If you then entered the following code: %%{{SetToken token=\"diceRoll\" value=\"+random(1,6)\"}}%% You would increment the value by another random number between one and six - this accurately simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice.\n\n~- **Coming soon:** The ability to duplicate token values and set token values in relation to one another.\n----\n=== 2.3. Conditional Logic ===\nWe've already seen that we can use \"\"\"InvHasOne\"\"\", \"\"\"InvHasNone\"\"\" and \"\"\"InvHasAll\"\"\" to test whether a player is carrying a particular object or objects (see code in TromaNightAdventure for examples of this). What's more useful is the ability to integrate more complex logic into your WikiGames:\n\n~- You can test the value of a token, the state of the inventory, or the currently logged-in user, using the Test directive. The result of the Test is executed immediately. The syntax is: %%{{Test if=\"[expression]\" then=\"[result]\"}}%% It is also possible to add an 'else' clause, which will be executed if the expression evaluates to false, using: %%{{Test if=\"[expression]\" then=\"[result]\" else=\"[other result]\"}}%%\n\n~- Expressions are written in the form \"1 = 2\". For example, the following code: %%{{Test if=\"1 = 2\" then=\"One is equal to two!\" else=\"One is not equal to two!\"}}%% Will always print out \"One is not equal to two!\", because the expression \"1 = 2\" will always evaluate to false. However, the code: %%{{Test if=\"1 = 1\" then=\"Yay; they're the same!\" else=\"They're not the same!\"}}%% Will always return \"Yay; they're the same!\", because \"1 = 1\" will always evaluate to true.\n\n~- Valid operators for use in expressions are = (equal to), < (less than), and > (greater than).\n\n~- You can substitute a token value in place of a literal in an expression using the getToken function, as shown below: %%{{Test if=\"getToken(playerScore) > 50\" then=\"You got over fifty points!\" else=\"You got fifty or less points!\"}}%% This snippet of code will print out \"You got over fifty points!\" is the value in the \"playerScore\" variable is greater than 50, and \"You got fifty or less points!\" otherwise. Be advised that it is not sensible to increment a player's score \"on the fly\" during a game, as they may (accidently or deliberately) press the \"refresh\" button on their browser to increment their score again! Better to set a series of tokens for each \"achievement\" they have managed on their journey, and add up a score at the end (see TromaNight230 - the TromaNightAdventure score page, for an example of this).\n\n~- You can even compare tokens to one another, e.g. %%{{Test if=\"getToken(money) > getToken(sense)\" then=\"You have more money than sense!\"}}%%\n\n~- You can use a Test code block to execute other syntax blocks (for example, \"\"\"SetToken\"\"\" or [[WikiFormattingRules images]]), but this is a nightmare to get your head around. Look at example code in, for example, WikiScissorsStonePaper for an example, and look at the following code block (notice use of ~(, ~, and }~ inside the \"then\" block): %%{{Test if=\"getToken(money) = 0\" then=\"You have no money, so the old man gives 5 coins: ~{SetToken token=~money~ value=~+5~}~\"}}%%\n\n~- You can also use all the usual boolean operators (and, or, and not [expressed an a preceeding exclamation mark]). For example: %%{{Test if=\"(getToken(money) = 0) and !(getToken(visitedOldMan) = 1)\" then=\"YYou have no money, and the 'visitedOldMan' token is not equal to 1.\"}}%%\n\n~- Other constructs that can be used in an expression include isUser(\"\"\"UserName\"\"\"), which evaluates to 'true' if the player is logged in as the specified user name, hasItem(\"\"\"ItemName\"\"\"), which evaluates to true if the player has the specified item in thier inventory, and countItems(\"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\"), which evaluates to the number of items from the slash-seperated list that the player has. In the example (countItems(\"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\")), this would evaluate to 3 only if the player had \"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\", \"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\", and \"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\"; to 2 if he had only 2 of them, and so on.\n\n~- **Do not try to embed a Test block within a Test block**. If you need this kind of multi-level functionality, you will need to set a temporary token and test for it later, in a seperate test block.\n\n~- **Tip 1**: Remember that Test blocks, like \"\"\"SetToken\"\"\" and the like, will print out a blank line on the resulting page if you put them on a line by themselves (which could leave giveaway 'gaps' on your page, indicating that code is being run). To alleviate this, try to put code blocks (series' of Tests, etc) on the same line.\n\n~- **Tip 2**: The whitespace in Test expressions is necessary. Sorry.\n\n~- **Tip 3**: If you get stuck, find DanHuntley on the [[ChatRoom RockMonkey ChatRoom]] and drop him a note and he'll try to sort it for you. =o)"},{"tag":"CurryFire","body":"Standard evening activity in AberWorld.

A man is always in a state of heightened awareness, ready to defend his woman and property from all challengers. However, a man should also be able to relax around his friends, and shouldn't worry too much about his appearence in social situations. Your attitude should have more of an impact than how you look, so there is no need to follow this chapter to the letter.\n\nIn order to discourage any attempts to lower your status from competing males, you need to perfect a stance which will make you seem both threatening, yet relaxed and confident.\n\nIt is often said that your body-language is that which says the most about you. A man's body language shouldn't //say// anything about you, it should //shout// about you.\n\n===Standing===\n\nIf standing, you should have your arms folded, and you should be leaning against something. If possible, cross one leg over the other, to give an appearence of relaxation. \n\nIf possible, you should never fully face someone who is talking (unless the conversation involves physical threats, interesting conversation, or a lady), but always keep your gaze pointed slightly to the side of your focal point. This will benefits you in two ways; first, it makes the person addressing you think you are uninterested, and hence they will try harder to engage you. This lowers their status in the group, as they're having to compete to gain you attention; this behaviour reinforces your dominance over everyone around you. Secondly, it lets you increase your field of vision, which may give you that valuable fraction of a second required in the event of an attack, or if a lady walks into the room.\n\n(todo: insert a picture of this stance here)\n\nWhen standing and talking to a lady, you need to emphasise your strength and virility, without offending her. A simple way to do this is to put both hands in your pockets. This draws her attention to your groin (which is where it should be), and allows you to broaden you shoulders, which subconciously makes her think you have good genetc stock, and so makes you more attractive as a mate.\n\n(todo: insert picture of this here)\n\n===Sitting===\n\n\n\n==== Chapter Two: Attitude ====\n\n==== Chapter Three: Communication ====\n\n===Part 1: Cursing.===\n\nWhen you're cursing someone of something, don't hold back. If you string various SwearWords together, and slowly build their level of profanity - you always end up in one of two possible places. [[Fuck]], or [[Cunt]].\n\nHence, you need to cut out anything before those. A real man knows what he wants to say, and is confident in his opinions.\n\nHence:\n\n~-\"[[Piss]] off\" becomes \"[[Fuck]] off\".\n~-\"I don't like you\" becomes \"You're a [[Cunt cunt]]\".\n~-\"I don't like you, go away\" becomes \"[[Fuck]] off you fucking [[Cunt cunt]]\".\n\nAnd so on.\n\n=== Exercises for this section ===\n\nTo become more manly you may also wish to experiment with putting different things in your pocket, eg:\n\nPenKnife- Manly\nLighter- Manly\nBigShinyTorch- Manly\nPinkGirlyHankerchief- not manly\nPicture of Mummy- not manly\na daisy- not manly\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Find someone in the street and tell them to '[[Fuck]] off'. If they say anything back, shout '[[Cunt]]!' at the top of your voice. \n\n2. Start saying '[[Fuck fuck]]' and '[[Cunt cunt]]' in your everyday sentances. \"Could you make me a fucking bacon sandwich, please?\", or \"To Penbryn Halls, Mr Taxi Driver, you [[Cunt cunt]]\". Mix it up a little. Try 'fucking [[Cunt cunt]]', or even 'cunting [[Fuck fuck]]'.\n\n==== Chapter Four: Women ====\n\n==== Chapter Five: Food ====\n\nBeing a man doesn't involve much cooking. \n\nIf you've read this far, you should be able to either coerce a woman or threaten a man into doing it for you. However, you do need to be the master of two thing; meat and barbecues.\n\n=== Meat ===\n\nGood meat is the cornerstone of a manly diet. You need to eat meat at least twice a day, preferable for breakfast and for your evening meal. This way, you'll never lose the taste for blood that a true man craves.\n\nI won't go into detail about how to prepare and cook meat, because it's not my forte. Your woman should deal with these things. However, it is important to remember that a true man will only appreciate good quality meat. While a McDonalds hamburger may take the hunger away for a while, only a real fillet steak, rubbed with pepper and barbecue sauce will truly satisfy a real man.\n\n=== Barbecue ===\n\nWhether you're cooking sausages in a hole in the ground on an open fire, or cooking steak for 50 on a multi-plate outdoor barbecue which needs it's own forest to power, you need to follow some simple rules.\n\n* Always stay in control. The alpha-male in a given situation is always the one holding the tongs, fighting it out toe-to-toe with the raging heat of the flames. If you're not that man, you're a nobody at this meal. \n\n* Don't let anyone take your position in front of the barbecue from you, no matter what is offered. You may be tempted to leave the flames for a second, to open a beer, to chat to your mates, or even to cool off (poof). Don't do this. \n\n* Be wary of challengers. As sure as you've been basking in the attention of being the primary male, you can be sure that someother guy is just waiting to whip the tongs and apron from you and take your position. Remember, no-one looks at the guy who is slicing the bread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\nSee also JonAtkinson, ManlyMen\n----"},{"tag":"Wizards","body":"Makers of mythical magic, wearers of beards \n\nGYBBH"},{"tag":"SinglePeople","body":"People not currently InARelationship with another; man/women/beast/plant/mineral and definetly not in an AbusiveRelationship.\n\nFor example:\n~- BrynSalisbury\n~- GarethBowker\n~- MattReynolds\n~- PaulMann\n~- KtErrington\n~- SundeepBraich because she has an arranged marriage, as we all know.\n\n----\n[[CategoryPeople List of all people]]"},{"tag":"GeneralElection","body":"A traditional British mudslinging competition, held every four or five years, in which everyone votes for the party whose leader they like best, and whose policies they know least about.\n\nUsually accompanied by sufficient NegativeCampaigning to ensure the slightly-clever-than-average-voters spend the entire campaign wondering why one party hates the other so much they're more concered with smearing them than announcing any policies of their own.\n\n----\nThe General Election for 2005 will be held on May the 5th.\n\n\n"},{"tag":"ReligiousArguments","body":"From now on this page shall at least be the starting point for all critism of Religions and ReligiousArguments.

They make lots of powdered milk. One day [[Paedophiles paediatricians]] started to tell people that breast milk was better for babies than powdered milk. They weren't just saying this; they had lots of impressive numbers and words with which to back it up. This left Nestle with lots of powdered milk that they couldn't sell to people in the WesternWorld because most of the ones with kids also had [[Tits tits]] too. So they started looking around for people who didn't know that powdered milk wasn't as good for babies as breast milk. They found them on a rather large continent predominantly populated by black people called Africa. Now parts of Africa are not as well developed in terms of infrastructure as the WesternWorld and so some people are less well educated and will believe, as most people will, anything told to them by someone in authority. Nestle went to some of these people and tried to sell them powdered milk but since they weren't [[Americans a people who would buy any old tat simply to own it]] they asked why they should buy powdered milk when it came out of their jubbly bits for free?\n\nThis is where Nestle turn into [[Bastards bastards]].\n\nThey said that powdered milk was better for babies than breast milk in contravention of the //International Code of Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes//. Many people believed this and so bought the powdered milk. Powdered milk requires water to reconstitute it and in parts of Africa water can be hard to come by. Since the parents wanted their children to be healthy they would use what little clean water they had to make up an inferior substitute for breast milk to feed to their babies. This would leave the parents either without clean water or sometimes without any water at all and also, since they were no longer using their breast milk, they stopped lactating as well.\n\nNestle's lies led to many deaths, both of children and parents, and also affected the development of the children's immune systems.\n\nThe [[StudentsUnion NUS]] were one of the groups to actually do something when they heard about this rather than going 'meh'. They banned all Nestle goods from Student Unions and wrote many petitions. The Nestle boycot is international and was first brought into effect in the US by //[[http://www.infactcanada.ca/InfactHomePage.htm INFACT]]// but the problem was highlighted by the //War On Want// who are affiliated to the international group //SOLIDAR//, all of whom are areligious and apolitical.\n\nThe problem is that Nestle are  big. Huge in fact. They won't care that a small group within society have banned the products of one of their divisions from a limited number of retail outlets that usually only have a select customer base anyway.\n\nThankfully the point of a boycott is not to harm a company's profits but is a)to draw attention to the issue and b)to create a PR problem for the company. The [[StudentsUnion NUS]] boycott is clearly effective in this respect as most people reading this page probably first heard about this issue because of it.\n\nBut Nestle are still bastards.\n\n----\n\n[[Wrong It should be pointed out that this account is not entirely correct]]. Nestle said it was superior to breast milk with reference to the transfer of HIV from a breast feeding mother to her new born baby. The Anti-Nestle campaign people love to leave this little detail out which is stupid. It is why the AntiNestleCampaigners are in fact the bigger bastards.\n\nNote the Anti Nestle campaign was as far as I'm aware started up by Christian Fundamentalists who (amongst other things) believe that HIV is a punishment from God upon the wicked.\n\n//The Nestle boycot began in 1977 which is 4 years before AIDS was recognised and 6 years before HIV was was isolated from the blood. It was concerned solely with selling inferior and unnecessary products to a people through the medium of lies.//\n\n//The section regarding the boycot has been updated since this post. I couldn't find anything linking the origins of the boycot with Christian Fundamentalists.//\n\n//As a point of information, by far and away the most common variant of HIV in Africa is HIV-2 which is not transmitted through breast milk.//\n\n----\nFrom what I know of it, a large chunk of the Nestle boycott was got up by Quakers in the [[UnitedKingdom UK]], which you'd be bloody hard pushed to describe as \"fundamentalists\"...\n\nAlso, I doubt fundamentalists would actually go to the trouble of boycotting Nestle in a bid to further the spread of HIV, because, mostly, they believe HIV is a punishment from God upon the homosexuals (who developed it first) so breast-feeding babies born after hetrosexual sex doesn't really come into it from that perspective.\n\n--MisterJTA\n\nPaulMann adds that there is no evidence that they \"developed it first\" - it's just that the HIV virus was first isolated in male homosexuals... This may have been a result of biased news reporting, since male homosexuals were the only population segment investigated at the time, because everybody thought it was confined to them...\n\n----\n\nIf I'm wrong I'll admitt my mistake as can't find my orginal sources at this present time but, I think your wrong about HIV not being  recognised till 1981 though will agree with it not being widely known.

If a more primitive Common Troll is encountered, it will fortunately be less skillful in battle, for it will not have had the benefit of military training.

Their favourite weapons are spears and battle-axes, and they also use shields and odd scraps of armour to protect themselves.

They have scaly green skins, webbed hands and feet, and gills in their necks, but otherwise look much like Cave Trolls. They live on fish, but occasionally manage to overturn a boat or pluck a tasty [[human]] from a riverbank. They can only survive in air for a few minutes, but that is usually enough for them to grab someone with their claws, bite depply into his neck, and leap back in to the water with him. They are hated by Merfolk, who will try to kill the things if they stray too near to their territory. Sea Trolls make their lairs in underwater caves, often hiding them with weed for protection.

Some say the race of Dragonkind is as old as time itself; there were certainly Dragons around to be recorded in the first histories of mankind. In the past the old civilizations were great allies of the Dragons, and they shared much knowledge. Young Dragons allowed themselves to be ridden by humans, even in battle, where their combined powers helped drive the armies of Chaos and Evil back under the ground.\n\nNowadays the old Dragons hide themselves away, sleeping out the millennia until civilization needs them again. Younger Dragons still stalk the [[Earth]], but many are evil creatures, concerned only with acquiring gold and treasure. In some of the newer kingdoms there are people who have never seen a Dragon, for they are now very rare creatures.\n\nDragons are the noblest of all reptilian races, gigantic winged creatures with long necks and tails. There are many subspecies, each with its own skin colour and other individual species. All Dragons can fly, and most can speak a wide variety of [[human]] and animal languages. Dragons are able to spit fire, acid or ice from their mouths. They also have claws and fangs; even without their fatal breath they would be more than a match for the strongest opponents. They come in different sizes and strengths, according to their age. Dragons seem to be all but immortal, and they mature only very slowly. Dragons are called young between the time they burst out of the egg and reach one hundred years of age, by which time they may have grown up to twelve metres long. They are impetuous, as Dragons go, and may be encountered in partnership with a powerful [[human]] such as a sorceror or evil leader who can provide both protection and regular food. Young Dragons do not know much of magic or books, as they are far too busy acquiring treasure to learn from wizards or converse with sages.\n\n====Misconceptions====\n~- Dragons are not always red\n~- Not all dragons hoard treasure\n~- Not all dragons are sentient\n~- Not all dragons hate [[human humans]]\n~- Not all dragons can breathe fire\n~- Not all dragons are magical to the extent of Brass Dragons\n\n====Life====\nAdult Dragons are aged between one hundred and five hundred years old, and can grow up to about twenty-five metres in length. There are very few adults known to mankind, for they are very rare and spend much of their time sleeping on their vast hoards in cavernous halls deep below a mountain or castle.\n\nOld Dragons have not been seen by anyone for many hundreds of years, and it is thought they may have left this earth to live on the MagicalPlanes in peace. For this reason there are no details of them in the following descriptions. It is very unlikely they will be encountered by adventurers on the EarthlyPlane.\n\nThe skin of a Dragon will easily fetch a pretty price, whereupon it can be used by skilled craftsmen to make superb armour. Actually acquiring the skin of a Dragon is another matter. Plus, it's cruel.\n\nA wet start to August usually means a good breeding season for Dragons, who will hatch sometime the following summer. Dragons have the curious habit of consuming foliage from chestnut trees where available, shortly after sunrise. Leaves consumed at this time do not travel down the normal digestive tract, but go instead into a second stomach set forward and a little below that which the Dragon uses to digest food. Here, in this second stomach, the leaves are converted into sedimentary layers of humus which, encouraged by the Dragon's body heat, gives off vast quantities of methane gas. Once a Dragon is four months old, it develops crystalline extrusions on its upper fangs and a thin layer of natural metallic capping on the lower. The result of these developments is that when the dragon snaps its jaws together sharply, it produces a spark. This spark will normally ignite the almost continuous flow of methane from the second stomach, producing a the fiery dragon breath which is such a distinctive feature for those breeds which produce it.\n\n====European Dragons vs Eastern Dragons====\nWhen most people think of dragons, they think of the European dragon. However, the eastern dragon has deeper roots in mythology. Typically an Eastern dragon will be amiable to [[human humans]], whereas a European dragon won't be. Eastern dragons also don't usually have legs, and tend to represent earth spirits, such as water\n\n====Common Types of Dragon====\n**Black Dragons** are usually encountered in rough, hilly terrain, where they may be preying upon villages for their livestock or people. Both young and adult Black Dragons make their lairs in caverns, to which they will return after a day's hunting. Younger creatures will have only a small, cramped cave, but an adult may occupy a vast cavern complex, housing a tribe of [[Goblins]] or [[Orcs]] as well as various other monsters, with several secret entrances for when danger threatens. Doesn't breathe fire, but can breathe a cloud of poisonous gas. Young creatures can create one up to three metres in diameter, an adult twice that.\n\n**Brass Dragons** have yet to be confirmed by many sources, for reasons given later. All people can agree on is that they are very bad news indeed. There have only been five authenticated appearances of Brass Dragons in the whole of recorded [[human]] history: two in Asia, one in Europe, one in Spain and one which turned up in Londinium before the Romans left. In every instance, the destruction wrought was massive. Three-quarters of Londinium was demolished or ravaged by fire, and seventeen of the very finest Roman Legions completely wiped out before the beast stupidly consumed the entire stock of an ale-house and drowned after falling drunkenly into the Thames. While the natural history of other breeds is relatively well known, no-one really has the last idea where Brass Dragons come from, what laws govern their abrupt appearance, or how to get rid of them when they do appear. Typically, a Brass Dragon will turn up out of the blue, run riot for several months or years, and then simply disappear (The Drowned Dragon of Londinium was unusual in the way it met its fate). No-one has ever succeeded in killing one. One reason for this noteworthy failure is that there is every indication Brass Dragons may be magical. \n\nThe largest and noblest of all their race, **Gold Dragons** are only rarely encountered by [[human humans]]. They prefer to inhabit large towers or castles in the middle of deserts or at the top of mountains, well removed from most other creatures. They are better disposed towards [[human humans]] than other Dragons, though they cannot understand that their short lifespan makes them seem impatient and rude. Gold Dragons tend to be especially friendly with sages and sorcerors, who sometimes visit them with questions on ancient history and magic. The Dragons dislike the more primitive and violent humanoid races, though, and will normally attack them on sight. Gold Dragons can breathe a wide jet of flame, broad enough to hit two opponents. Creatures aged more than about seventy years may also have magical spells to back up their claws and teeth; they are particularly fond of illusions and tricks. The armoured hide of a Gold Dragon is very tough.\n\nA young **Green Dragon** may be encountered amid the tangles at the centre of a large forest, where it will make its lair in an old ruin or a shallow cave in a hillside. An adult creature will only be encountered deep in a tropical jungle, well away from any settlements, where it can enjoy being the largest and most voracious predator in the region. Green Dragons are natural hunters, both quick and cunning, and make fearsome opponents. They can breathe out a thin stream of fire, adults causing more damage than youngsters.\n\n**Red Dragons** are hoarders who relish collecting coins, jewels and all other valuable items. When encountered, a Red Dragon will usually be in its cavern, sprawled across the top of a large pile of treasure. Red Dragons are automatically suspicious of anyone they encounter, believing them to be thieves intent on stealing their treasure, and will attack them immediately. They can shoot fire-balls from their mouths, which they send roaring through the air to explode on their target, and can shoot them up to twenty-five metres with surprising accuracy. This is the type of Dragon most frequently portrayed in Western Fiction.\n\n**Silver Dragons** have long been the arch-enemies of their Gold cousins, for they are very jealous of their status among the rest of Dragonkind. They seem to be perpeptually plotting against their noble relations, though events rarely get violent. Silver Dragons live in desolate areas away from other creatures, for they can be bad-tempered and aggressive. In an attack a Silver Dragon can shoot out a chilling sheet of cold that is wide enough to hit two opponents at once. Silver Dragons fear fire though, and would rather give away part of their vast treasure-hoard than face several creatures wielding it against them.\n\nOf all the desolate, inhospitable places that Dragons inhabit, nowhere is worse than that of the **White Dragons**. They can only survive in sub-zero temperatures, so they will only ever be encountered amid the snow and ice of the extreme North or South. They dwell in vast caves or castles carved from the ice itself. They are the most unpredictable of all Dragons, and will normally eat any being they come across. In keeping with its frigid home, a White Dragon can breathe out a stream of ice that will freeze its opponent. A White Dragon will not eat its dead prey straight away. Sometimes, especially when the long winter draws near, they will leave the bodies inside large blocks of ice, to keep until other food is scarce, when they will claw them out and eat them at their leisure.\n\nSee also [[Cinerus]] and [[Sskahryl]]\n\n----\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"},{"tag":"Manticore","body":"Alias of JosephSimpson\n\nIn that case, I hope I never meet him - PaulMann\n\nManticores were created centuries ago by an insane warlock from places unknown, fooling with things that should have been left well alone.

They will attack with their claws or their sting, alternately slashing and striking at their opponent. In a Manticore's lair there will be innumerable bones, the sorry relics of its past victims.

They have a strong bite augmented by severe infection of wounds, caused by the some 50 different strains of bacteria in their saliva. After they bite, they release their prey to allow it to die before devouring it; this allows them to avoid injury. Dragons will fight over kills, however unlike any other known animal, they are themselves immune to bacterial infection from dragon bites.\n\n{{image class=\"left\" alt=\"Another Komodo Dragon\" url=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/250px-Waran.jpg\"}}\nDragons eat any animals they can catch, up to the size of wild pigs, goats, deer, and water buffaloes and occasionally including human beings.

You can eat any item of food at any time which will restore your Life Force to GREEN. Your Life Force cannot go above GREEN.\n\n4. You can carry up to two objects at a time. If you find an item which you want but you already have two, you must discard one. Objects from level 1 cannot be used in level 2 and so on.\n\n5. You will sometimes be given spells to use during your adventure. You can only use up to three spells in your quest. Most spells are useful in several situations, but there will usually be one special situation that each spell is particularly helpful in dealing with. Choose the right moment to cast your spell, since a spell can only be used once.\n\n6. Remain true to the Code of Chivalry: be courageous, dutiful and just, protect the weak, and show honour even in adversity.\n\nOne final point - the RIGHT-hand path is usually the best path to take, unless you are advised otherwise.\n----\nWith thanks to [[http://www.knightmare.com/ Knightmare.com]]."},{"tag":"ASSAPhaseTwo","body":"====ASSA PHASE TWO====\n\n===Phase Two: Part One===\n\nFor reasons best known only to himself.

Side Projects include [[Space]], TheOrb, AdvancedAcousticArmaments, and BlackSmoke\n\nThis article is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the moniker TheKLF\n---------------\n**1. Pure trance originals**\n\nNot to be confused with the \"Pure Trance Series\", envisaged as 10 x 2000 limited edition 12\" singles, released weekly in September-December 1988. That never happened, although the labels were printed\n\nAnyway, the \"pure trance originals\" typically refers to the original releases of \"What Time is Love?\", \"3am Eternal\" and \"Last Train to Trancentral\", which are nothing like the later \"stadium techno\" versions most people are familiar with. They are much slower, and more like ambient stuff. Quite pleasant, but you can see why they weren't very popular\n---------------\n**2. Shag Times**\n\nA kind of \"Greatest Hits\" compilation. Contains mostly JAMs stuff, \"Doctorin' The Tardis\" and a couple of remixed KLF tracks. Annoyingly, all the KLF tracks and remixes are listed as (incorrect) BPM readings, instead of the titles. The gits.\n---------------\n**3. Kylie Said to Jason**\n\nThis was going to be the first single off the \"White Room\" soundtrack (see later). Unfortunately, it bombed, and so the soundtrack was never released. Which is a shame really as this track is excellent. Reminds me of \"Domino Dancing\" by the Pet Shop Boys, but with better singing\n---------------\n**4. The White Room (OST)**\n\nWhen \"Kylie Said to Jason\" tanked, this release was cancelled, despite it already being completed. So the studio engineer stole copies and leaked it out, so it's quite easy to find. The tracks on this differ quite a lot from the \"proper\" White Room album. Very pleasant light synth-pop stuff, especially \"Kylie Said to Jason\", the album version of \"3am Eternal\" (a cut-down version of the \"pure trance\" mix) and \"Go to Sleep\"\n---------------\n**5. The White Room (The film)**\n\nMade using the money they got from TheJAMs and \"Doctorin' The Tardis\", it's a 50 minute ambient road movie describing Bill and Jimmy's quest to find \"The White Room\". Unfortunately it's rather dull. Only been shown in public once. Allegedly made because they received letters from someone claiming to be from the Illuminatus. Spot the flaw there. Anyway... they were given a contract which required them to make \"an artistic representation of themselves on a journey to a place called THE WHITE ROOM\". So they did. Hence the film. Duh.\n\nMost of the footage shot was out of focus or otherwise unuseable, and they ran out of money to finish it. They decided on the ending of the film (based on a \"get out clause\" they found on the \"real\" contract. The plan was to show the film silently, and play the soundtrack live. Unfortunately the film is kind of tedious, and the failure of \"Kylie Said to Jason\" didn't help. The plan was to have an \"inner\" film and an \"outer\" film, with the driving-footage being the inner film, and the \"outer\" film telling the plot. They couldn't find sponsors to finish the film as apparently it was \"too weird\". The plot itself isn't too well known, but it is believed that it follows the story of the Illuminatus and the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. \n\nSeems once they because successes through their \"Stadium techno\" releases, they kind of lost interest in the film. A shame really. In addition, no-one knows what happened to the original film. All that remains is a mostly-silent 42 minutes film, with the soundtrack dubbed on from the official soundtrack in appropriate places (so there are long periods of silence with not much happening). Still intriguing to watch though\n---------------\n**6. Chill Out**\n\nRecorded live, without edits, in one take, by the KLF only. Every time they made a mistake, they started over.\n\n'The UK CD has only one track, 45 minutes long. The US CD separates this into 14 tracks, based on the \"song\" titles and approximate timings printed on the label of the UK LP. It seems that the KLF consider Chill Out to be one continuous piece of music, but had to invent a separation into songs so that song-writing royalties can be paid to those sampled' (KLF FAQ)\n---------------\n**7. Live at Trancentral/SSL/Lost Continent**\n\nThe \"Stadium techno\" releases of \"3am Eternal\", \"Last Train to Trancentral\" and \"What Time is Love\" most people know the KLF for. Not really live at Trancentral/The SSL/The Lost Continent, they instead used crowd samples. Natch.\n---------------\n**8. The White Room (Album)**\n\nThe only \"real\" album the KLF released, and it isn't what people were expecting. It still sold millions though. The first half comprises of the \"live\" versions of their well known tracks (see above), and the second half is much more laid back, with heavily remixed versions from the \"White Room\" soundtrack (no \"Kylie\" though), ending with an absolutely *beautiful* version of \"Justified and Ancient\"\n\nThe US version ruined this and edited the first five tracks, eliminating the crowd noise and generally making a mess of it. It jumps and cuts very abruptly. The US edition also has the single mix of 'Last Train To Trancentral' instead of the mellower UK album version, edits 'No More Tears' down from 9:24 to 6:42, and adds a little more wind noise at the end of the closing 'Justified and Ancient'\n---------------\n**9. America - What Time is Love?**\n\nA remixed and remastered version, since the KLF realised they hadn't \"Broken America\" yet. Seems to appeal to patriotism, using phrases such as \"This great land\" and chants of \"America\" throughout. Quite funny to listen to objectively as it makes you realise quite how manipulative it is. Still sold well though\n\nI'm sure \"America - Fuck Yeah!\" from TeamAmericaWorldPolice is an indirect parody of this, because the crowd chants are very similar, and they both end with a long list of \"great\" things, though in this case it's the names of cities\n---------------\n**10. The Rites of Mu**\n\nThis took place during the 1991 Summer Solstice. A small group of journalists and reporters were invited to the \"Lost Continent of Mu\". \"The guests were welcomed from the ferry by Mu passport control officer Drummond in peaked cap and shades, who checked their passports and stamped them with a pyramid blaster stamp. They then allowed themselves to be dressed in yellow ceremonial robes, and led in a chanting procession by a white robed high priest of Mu with Horned God headpiece, over the moors to a bonfire beside a huge wicker man, arms raised with weapons poised, head looking up to the sky. The four angels of Mu, in white dresses, with flower head-bands, rose from the sea, and joined the celebrants. The high priest addressed the crowd in 'a tongue that no longer exists, at least not in this world'. What did the KLF have in store, or was it the Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu controlling the KLF? As the ceremony reached its climax at midnight on the longest day, it was still light. The priest encouraged the guests to direct their psychic energy towards the wicker man, chanting 'Burn Burn Burn' and the idol burst into flames! What lay ahead was 'enlightenment ... or madness'. After the ceremony was over the guests were treated to a huge party. The next day is unrecorded but judging by the statement it involved savouring the undervalued qualities of waiting. However they spent the time, by Sunday 23rd of June, the KLF had transported the guests to the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, where, hooded, they joined them on stage for an accapella rendition of Justified And Ancient as Bill and Jimmy handed out ice creams from an ice-cream van which they had borrowed. The total cost of the weekend was supposed to be around 70,000 ukpounds. But for what?\" (KLF FAQ)\n\nWho knows. But the transcription CD makes interesting listening\n---------------\n**11. Justified and Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)**\n\nTheir best known work, partially thanks to a wonderful country singer called TammyWynette (RIP). Quite different from the album version, and includes such things as a rap and a bouncier drum loop. Their last \"official\" release0\n---------------\n**12. The KLF with Extreme Noise Terror (BRIT awards)**\n\n\"Somehow the KLF persuaded the organisers to let them perform with Extreme Noise Terror, and they began to plan their performance. \"The plans kept changing. They varied from me going onstage and literally cutting my age, Manics style into my chest with a knife, to me snogging Jimmy onstage, to Jimmy simulating sex with his girlfriend. Then we were going to cut up a dead sheep on stage and throw blood over the front rows of the audience. The idea was that two thirds of the way through the song this altar would appear with the sheep on... we'd bought the meat cleavers, the knives, the tablecloth, got everything.\" Drummond explains how such ideas come to them: \"we don't always think things through beforehand...we just do them. Jimmy really had me going, he suggested that I use the cleaver to cut my own hand off!\"\n\nOn the morning of the show (12th February '92) Drummond drove to an abattoir in Northampton and bought a whole dead sheep and eight gallons of blood. Rumours began to circulate of the plan, and first the BBC lawyers and then hardcore vegetarians Extreme Noise Terror made it blatantly known that they were totally against the idea.\" So the sheep plan was scrapped, and instead *just* the thrash performance, and Bill spraying the audience with blanks from a machine gun took place. There's no doubt however that this performance did annoy, shock and disgust many of the 'pigtails in suits' present in the audience and presumably many of the live TV audience in their living rooms. Trevor Horn (producer of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \"Relax\") seemed to be in a state of shock. \"They were horrible! Shooting with machine guns! Disgraceful!\". Eminent Hungarian classical composer Sir George Solti tried to leave the auditorium during the performance and had to be persuaded to return to his seat.\n\nAs Scott Piering's voice announced \"The KLF have now left the music business\" the two bands hurried off the stage and straight into their van and back to Trancentral. Later in the show The KLF (jointly with Simply Red) were awarded the title Best British Band. Since they had now left the building they sent along sidekick Hector, resplendent in motor cycle messenger gear, to pick up the statuette. Having been told there was no way he was being allowed access, Hector dashed onstage, grabbed the trophy from startled Martika and escaped into the labyrinth of corridors behind the glittering stage. This of course was cut from the TV coverage. Later, he was cornered by security, who wrestled 'the BRIT' back off him.\n\nThe BRIT award statuette was later unearthed in a field near Stonehenge by a local farmer. From Q Magazine: \"The yeoperson's shovel-wielding presence remains as unexplained as The KLF's wish to bury it there in the first place.\" Jimmy has been vague when questioned on this.\" (KLF FAQ)\n---------------\n**13. Unreleased singles**\n\n\"Deep Shit\"\n\"Love Trance\"\n\"The Lover's Side\"\n\"Deep Shit Part 3\"\n\"The White Room (soundtrack)\"\n\"No More Tears\"\n\"Go to Sleep\"\n\"Madrugada Eterna\"\n\nAnd hundreds of demos and the like. They weren't very good at releasing things, were they?\n\nOh, and then there's\n---------------\n**14. The Black Room**\n\n\"The legendary unreleased LP, the darker, harder twin to the White Room LP. It was referred to in interviews for ages, even before the White Room was released. Originally it was planned to be harder techno (like It's Grim Up North), then it was going to be heavy-metal techno (like America - What Time is Love?) and then it was going to be a thrash-metal collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror (like the TOTP version of 3 am Eternal). It's unknown, how much of each incarnation was complete, before it was scrapped and recording was re-started.\n\nJimmy said of it in December '90: \"The 'Black Room' album will all be this kind of electro turbo metal. It's not really industrial like, say, Throbbing Gristle, because it's coming from house and has an uplifting vibe about it. But it's so heavy it will just pin you to the floor.\"; while Drummond said of it in March '91: \"It's the compete yang to the yin of 'The White Room'. It'll be very very dense, very very hardcore. No sort of 'up' choruses or anthems. I think it's going to be techno-metal, I think that's gonna be the sound. Techno-metal. Which'll be, you know, a cross between Techno and Heavy Metal. Megadeth with drum machines.\"\n\nIt never happened. I (PaulMann) have some thrash-metal versions of White Room tracks, but have no way of verifying their source\n---------------\nCategoryBands"},{"tag":"TheOrb","body":"Ambeint-house group focusing around DrAlexPatterson.

In the early 1990s, the group was part of the New York City underground scene, partially due to the band's strange costumes, reminiscent of The Frogs (Kimmy typically dresses as a rabbit, Adam as Robin Hood - [[KtErrington Kt]]).

The K-F Prize**\n\nThe first thing anybody knew about TheKFoundation was when a series of adverts started appearing in national newspapers, declaring such bizarre phrases as \"Kick out the clocks\" and \"K time\", followed by \"Abandon All Art Now\"!\n\nTwo weeks later, another advert appeared, announcing \"It has come to our attention that you did not abandon all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce the 'mutha of all awards', the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of the year\"\n\nAnd they did. Coincidentally their shortlist was identical to that of the Turner prize, and the same person won. The K-Foundation prize was double that of the Turner prize (Ã¯Â¿Â½40,000)\n\nThe festival took place in a field, and the money was delivered in two bright orange armoured cars, with \"K Cera Cera\" and ABBA's \"Money Money Money\" blasting over the radio\n\n(See \"Nailed to a wall)\n\nThey then returned to the arts gallery, and announced that Rachael Whiteread (the Turner prize winner) had won the prize and if she didn't collect it, it would be burnt. She didn't make an apperance until someone caught sight of [[Gimpo]] fiddling with the lighter fluid and matches. The money was donated to needy artists\n----------------\n**2. Nailed to a wall**\n\nDuring the K-F Prize, A million pounds in Ã¯Â¿Â½50 notes was nailed to a large piece of wood and titled \"Nailed to a wall\". It was then auctioned, with the starting price at half a million, on the grounds that inflation will erode it's value over time, but art is priceless.\n\nSince the money now had holes in it, the Bank of England wouldn't take it back, and fined Bill and Jimmy Ã¯Â¿Â½9000 for damaging money, and charged them Ã¯Â¿Â½500 to reprint it.\n\nSources can't confirm this, but it may have given them ideas for their next stunt...\n----------------\n**3. 'Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid'**\n\nThey did. It was filmed by [[Gimpo]], and took place on the isle of Jura, Scotland. Yes, they really did it. There is video footage, witnesses, the bank confirmed it, and burnt Ã¯Â¿Â½50 notes kept appearing over the isle for the following few days.\n\nBill and Jimmy brought back around Ã¯Â¿Â½80,000 of it (partially burnt) and paid a potter to bake them into a brick.

Never terribly popular in the US\n\nAlmost bought by Atari, but Commodore got it instead.\n\n(in very rough chronological order)\n\n====A1000====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\nHorrible. 256kb RAM. OperatingSystem came on floppy, which had to be booted before you could run anything, even self-booting applications. Kickstart 1.0\n\n====A500====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\nThe first useable Amiga. 512k RAM. Kickstart 1.2. Has \"Rock Lobster\" inscribed on the motherboard because the developers were B52 fans. Immensely popular, and considered the \"base unit\" for about 6 years. Expansion slot known as the \"trapdoor\" due to it's location\n\n====A2000 A2500/B2000====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz, except for Unix A2000 with 68020 at 14.28Mhz\nBusiness machines. Some came with a variation of Unix. Expansion slots known as \"Zorro\" slots. 2500 had 1Mb of RAM and Kickstart 1.3, others had 512kb and Kickstart 1.2. Came with built in hard drive\n\n====A3000====\n68020 at 14.28Mhz\nThe first seriously high-end Amiga. The Video Toaster (see later) was produced for this. Came with \"Zorro 2\" expansion slots. 6Mb of RAM. Wow. Hideously expensive (I believe the model number reflects the price). Also available in Unix flavour. Came with Kickstart 2.04. Also available in tower format. Built in hard drive. Introduction of ECS chipset\n\n====CDTV====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\nA mistake. Cost around five hundred pounds. Basically an A500 with no keyboard, mouse or floppy drive, a cheap CD-unit, and an AWFUL handset. Could still play Lemmings and Sim City though. Came with Kickstart 1.3 despite 2.04 already completed\n\n====A1500====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\nAn A2000 with no hard drive and two floppy drives\n\n====A500+ A600====\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\nA replacement for the A500 with 1Mb of RAM as standard, Kickstart 2.04 and ECS chipset. A600 produced later (Almost called A300, but they wanted it to sound like an upgrade - motherboard still says A300), and was almost identical except for the lack of a numeric keypad, and a PCMCIA slot instead of a trapdoor\n\n====A4000/040 A4000/060====\n68040 at 40Mhz, or 68060 at 60Mhz\nThe best equipped Amiga ever produced. Came with the brand new Kickstart 3.01. Available in a tower. 2Mb of RAM. \"Zorro 3\" expansion slots, on a par with PCI (Though horribly incompatible due to the Motorola/Intel byte patterns being opposite). New AGA graphics chipset\n\n====A1200====\n68EC020 at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)\nA home users version of the A4000. Slower CPU (14.14Mhz), but still came with 2Mb of RAM, which surprised a lot of people. PCMCIA slot.  Workbench 3.0\n\n====CD32====\n68EC020 at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)\nTo the A1200 what the CDTV was to the A500. A better start, and much cheaper. In fact, quite a few titles were ported to the platform. Could play VideoCds, IF you bought the FMV module (Ã‚Â£60 or so), due to the native CPU not being fast enough. Not compatible with most CDTV titles\n\n====Custom Chips====\nWhat made the Amiga the most powerful home computer were it's custom chip sets. Individual chips to handle different tasks, taking the burden away from the CPU. Be fair, at the time, the Amiga was way ahead of the PC, just thanks to Commodore it was still in the same place 5 years later\n\nAgnus / Alice - the graphics chip. OCS (Original Chipset) and ECS (Enhanced Chipset) allowed up to 64 colours at 640x400. AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture, and the source of endless puns) allowed up to 256 colours at 640x400, and had a built in blitter\n\nPaula - the sound chip. Could mix up to four channels of incoming data (including resampling if needed) and output as a stereo steam.  The tracker module originated on the Amiga due to the power of this chip\n\nThere are more, but they aren't interesting. The CIA chips controlled the keyboard and disk drive, for example\n\n====Titles====\nLemmings, Worms, Zool, 3D Construction Kit, AMOS (Later STOS for the Atari and KlikAndPlay for the PC), Alien Breed, Cadaver, Gods, Magic Pockets, Speedball, James Pond (and Robocod), Pinball Fantasies, Theme Park, Cybercon 3, Chips Challenge (Later part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack), Llamatron, Lotus I II and III, Prince of Persia, Beneath a Steel Sky, The Secret Of Monkey Island, Captive, Loom, Syndicate, The Chaos Engine, Chuck Rock, Shadow of the Beast, Xenon 2, Sim City and most popular AtariSt titles originated on the Amiga, and promptly suffered in the transition (1/4 the number of colours and chip sound). Or worse, they were ported to the PC (In early cases, down to 4-16 colours, one channel sound)\n\nIn addition, serious titles like Deluxe Paint, POV-Ray, Lightwave (which led to the creation of 3D Studio Max as a competitor) and Cubase (almost certainly the origins of PropellorheadReason) had their origins on the Amiga\n\n====Advancements and Plugins====\nA501 and A520 were a hard drive and a memory expansion (not in that order) for the A500. Official CD drive produced for the A1200, but were beaten to the punch by Zappo, who produced one 6 months earlier for about Ã‚Â£100 less. Squirrel card allowed SCSI devices to be connected to the A1200, A600 and A4000. A few network cards produced, but most Amiga users connected via modem using AmiTCP\n\nThe likes of Power Computing produced lots of cool hardware for the Amiga, such as accelerator cards which could speed up your A1200 to up to 60Mhz with 20Mb of RAM. Nice. Or the Video Toaster which was used to produce a lot of video effects, including all the CGI for BabylonFive, and the videoscreen at the MiamiDolphins stadium in Florida. But people didn't want to upgrade\n\nGraphics cards became quite popular, with the likes of Picasso and Retina allowing 16-million colour in 800x600. A seriously nice piece of kit with practically no performance hit\n\n====What Happened Next====\nCommodore made hundreds of stupid decisions and it just became out-dated. The Amiga is still technically around (\"AmigaOne\"), but now it runs a form of BSD and uses Mac hardware, so you wonder how they can get away with calling it an Amiga\n\nEmulation is still very popular, and we have only just managed to get PCs which can successfully emulate the Amiga's custom chipset at any speed.\n\nGames are still being produced, an example being \"Payback\", at GTA clone. Not bad for 14.28Mhz, eh?\n\n====Pointless Trivia====\nThe Amiga floppy drive had a seek time of 4ms, slightly slower than the Atari's 3ms, but given they had at least twice as much memory, they didn't spend as long accessing the disk :)\n\nOne of the first computers to have a built in GUI as standard\n\nHAM-mode allowed up to (around) 262,400 colours to be displayed at once (still image only). This was done with some seriously messed-up maths which aren't important to this Wiki. Plus, the sheer size of the files meant most of your memory was gone while you displayed the picture\n\nThe Amiga had two types of memory. Chip memory and Fast memory. Both were identical physically, but the physical memory was divided up upon boot-up. Chip memory could be accessed by any of the chips, and fast memory could only be accessed by the CPU. Simple. However, any memory added via expansion boards could only be fast memory. There was no way to increase the amount of chip memory. 2Mb was your lot. In addition, some early programs and demos _required_ fast memory. Luckily there were software programs to dynamically shift the boundary, providing you had the free RAM to do it\n\nThe 68000 range of CPUs only used the even numbers. 68010 was an aborted attempt at acceleration, and only 000,020,040 and 060 were used. Rumours about of an 030, but I've never seen one. I think there may have been an accelerator for the A1200 with one...\n----\nBoringTechyPages\nCategoryElectronics"},{"tag":"BadTelevisionShows","body":"T.V. for the masses.

They all provided vocals and [[E]] was heavily involved in production of each of their records.\n\nThe band has gone through some personnel changes however [[E]] has remained constant and, much to the disamy of many [[eels]] fans, Butch has recently announced his departure from the group citing business, and not personal or creative, differences.\n\n[[eels]] (no 'The') sidled onto the music scene in 1998 with their debut album BeautifulFreak. They did not burst, nor explode but slowly drew cult recognition in the US and more widespread following in Europe. BeautifulFreak was hailed for its haunting and touching lyric and excellent production and provided two of [[eels]] chart hits; //Beautiful Freak// and //Novocaine For The Soul//.\n\nFans were forced to wait two years for the next album due to the deaths of many of [[E]]'s family and friends. His mother suffered from, and eventually succumbed to cancer and his sister Elizabeth took her own life. The first track of the album ElectroshockBlues was titled //Elizabeth On The Bathroom Floor// and spoke directly of her suicide. The track //The Medication Is Wearing Off// was written as a response to //Novocaine For The Soul// to describe the loss of cynical detachment and the gain of pain. The album was described by [[E]] as the most up-beat he would ever produce because, whilst it dealt with the death of his family it also focused on his passage through the grief and the reasons to carry on living. Whilst the melodies and the majority of the lyrics of the ElectroshockBlues album are depressing the song will almost always end with an acceptance of life over death.\n\nHaving worked through many of his emotional problems [[E]] was able to make DaisiesOfTheGalaxy a pleasent and joyful album (comparatively) and much more of a crowd pleaser.\n\n[[Souljacker]] was conceived, mainly, whilst [[E]] was ona spiritual retreat at which he was not allowed to speak or write. He became so creative during this time that he felt compelled to write what would become //Souljacker Part 2// on toilet roll and to hide it from the other members of the retreat. The album was co-produced by JohnParish and was another critical smash for [[eels]]. My particular favourite on the album is the track //Fresh Feeling//, a love song that re-uses a string quartet phrase that they used earlier in their career on the track //Selective Memory//. [[eels]] had used a similar trick before turning the instrumental for an early B-Side track Dog's Life into the instrumental for their song EfilsGod. What [[eels]] had started other bands had used and reaped rewards for.\n\nThe following album [[Shootenanny]]! (a term coined by [[E]] to describe a [[Hootennany]] with guns) was far less autobiographical and featured a number of songs that could be considered as coming very close to jokes (//Fashion Awards// and //Restraining Order Blues//) and whilst there were a couple od songs that spoke of depression they were non-specific. This turn angered many of the 'hardcore' fans who favoured the more emotional tracks that had been produced in the past. But no-one disputed that they still rocked.\n\nA new album is due for release in 2005 and it is unsure whether Butch will be providing the percussion accompaniment but what you can be sure of (apart from cliches in summaries) is that it will be bought by their fans and that those determined few will try to enlighten the rest of the world to their greatness.\n\n\nBest Album: [[Souljacker]]\n\nSee CrackingeelsLyrics\n---------------\nCategoryBands"},{"tag":"DavidByrne","body":"The only man RestlessBoy will admit to fancying.

Most of his works shares the common themes of vice, death, growing up and beauty in unexpected places. \n\n**List of works (or at least the ones JonAtkinson owns) with short descriptions:**\n\n~-TheWindupBirdChronicle - I very twisty novel that starts with Noboru Wataya (a cat) going missing, and ends with the Japanese massacres in Manchuria in WorldWarII. I think it's overrated.\n\n~-TheElephantVanishes - A collection of short stories. Most don't cover much time, so they're a little like looking at paintings, or polaroid photos. Interesting, because some of his characters from other books started from these short stories.\n\n~-AWildSheepChase - An unnamed protaganist starts to recieve strange letters from his friend, TheRat, and is contacted by a shadowy media organisation to track down a particular sheep from a particular photograph. Along the way, he stays at the DolphinHotel, meets TheSheepMan, and loses his girlfriend.\n\n~-DanceDanceDance - The sequel to AWildSheepChase sees the anonymous anti-hero recovering from the events of the previous book. He decided to put the past to rest, and try to find his lost girlfirend  by returning to the DolphinHotel. However, much has changed, and along the way he meets a depressed movie star, a beautiful 13 year old girl, and a man with one arm. This book also has the only 'cameo' role the author has ever written, appearing as himself under than name HakamiMakiumura.\n\n~-SputnikSweetheart - I wasn't too sure about this one. It has all the right ingredients (inreachable girl, unremarkable protagonist, greek island), but something didn't quite sit correctly with me. The story of Mui was very enjoyable, but I felt the ending brought in a new relationship too late in the novel. One for the hardcore, but the conclusion leaves you a little empty.\n\n~-AfterTheQuake - A collection of short stories all connected with the Kobe earthquake.\n\n~-NorwegianWood - A story about a student who falls in love while at university. When his lover vanishes, he sets off to find her in an asylum, and learns of her roomates past.\n\n~-BirthdayStories - Yes, yes, yes so good. I read this entirely in a couple of hours, and I'm still reeling a few weeks later. It's an anthology, which has short stories revolving around the theme of birthdays, ageing and the passage of time from (among others) PaulTheroux, DenisJohnson, RaymondCarver and RusselBanks. Murakami adds his own story too. I think the best story was probably 'The Birthday Cake', by DanielLyons.\n\n~-Hard-boilder Wonderland and the End of the World - Got this from [[HayleyDrew]] for Valentines day. Not read it yet.\n\n~-South of the Border, West of the Sun - As above.\n\nThere are more books, but I'll add them as I read them.\n\n**His other works (that SianThomas has read)**\n\n~-Underground - Non-fiction work about the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo underground by members of the Aum cult in which twelve people died and thousands were injured. This book contains interviews with the survivors. Fascinating look at the impact of the event on ordinary people and scary how many people just carried on working while suffering from sarin exposure.\n\n~-KafkaOnTheShore - His latest novel to be published here. Oedipal prophecies, talking cats, Hegel-quoting prostitues, ColonelSanders as a pimp, JohnnieWalker as a kitty killer, fish rainstorms. A bit hard to describe in other words (as with most Murakami) but it's fab.\n\n**Other Resources:**\n\n~- Salon.com has an [[http://www.salon.com/books/int/1997/12/cov_si_16int.html interview]] with Murakami.\n~- [[http://www.murakami.ch/main_2.html Murakami.ch]] also has some good articles.

Therein lies the conflict. A god that exists within the confines of this [[TheUniverse Universe]] who knows everything, even the future, defies the possibility of FreeWill of any other entity in the universe - after all: in a deterministic scenario such as this one, there is no FreeWill. Conversely, if that god exists outside of the universe as we can percieve it - and thereby, outside of the confines of Time - we are instead presented with a different paradox; that such a god is not, contrary to the claims of many theists, 'perfect'.\n\n//Could you please elaborate on why [[God]]'s existence outside of [[TheUniverse]] would preclude perfection?//\n\n//Ah, but knowing the possibilities does not preclude the possibilities being chosen. To choose a nearly-accurate example I know what results can occur from a fair six-sided die but that doesn't mean I know what number will come up the next time it's thrown. So to extend the analogy for TheHardOfThinking [[God]] can know what possibilities there are, and the subsequent consequences, and yet an [[individual]] still has FreeWill to choose from the limited possibilities.//\n\n//Also the argument is flawed in the assertion that [[God]] exists within this [[TheUniverse Universe]]. In the dominant world religions the various deities are set apart from [[TheUniverse]], either by predating it or transcending it. In such a situation we can only conject upon what possibilities exist with no method of varification.//\n\n''The word 'universe' - as I used it - does not mean - as you used it, \"the physical world\". However, I go on later to debate the theory of the existance of a god outside of the confines of a universe as we know it, and eventually conclude that such a god is unprovable in the extreme: a thing for which no evidence can ever exist, by simple definition of 'existance' being 'that which is, was, or will be in the universe'.''\n\n//''Apologies. When I used \"physical world\" it was because most religions were formulated in an age of general cosmic ignorance i.e. they were predominantly concerned with this physical world. I wasn't wanting to put words into the mouths of religions. Bad Juju lies down that path. Feel free to delete this.''// ''Nah; I like it.''\n\n**The argument would only be flawed if that was the only scenario I'd considered. Go back and read it more carefully - both boolean options are looked into. While you can state that a die will land on one of six sides, you cannot state which will occur, I concur... but an entity that knew _everything_ would. Which means that - as far as they were concerned - it makes no difference.**\n\n//**\"While you ... cannot state which will occur ... and entity that knew _everything_ would.\" This is confusing: you seem to say \"I agree with you but I'm still right\". You concur that the entity would not have certain knowledge of the outcome of an event but would know all possible sequences of events throughout [[Eternity]] (if such a thing exists). This then means that [[God]] can predict all possible futures but not one certain one. Hence, whilst [[God]] knows all futures [[God]] doesn't know the future. It would make no difference to [[God]]'s knowledge (as omniscient, nothing could) except that [[God]] would then know what has occurred.**//\n\nThe idea of a 'perfect' [[God]], as depicted by most theists, is in contradiction to that of a [[TheUniverse Universe]] in which FreeWill is possible. Perfection implies determinism, because determinism is the absolute absence of chaos, and chaos defies perfection.\n\n//The statement that 'chaos defies perfection' is subjective. Many people see beauty in cloud formations, shore lines and erosion patterns and whilst those phenomena are based upon physical systems the number of variables is so huge that the human mind reduces it to 'chaos'. If self-determinism exists it still limits the number of variables (whilst I can choose whether or not to stand up from my seat I cannot choose to fly).//\n\n**The beauty in cloud formations comes from the brain identifying with patterns within the chaos. I wasn't referring to self-determinism, I was talking about pure, literal, metaphysical determinism - i.e. is there any randomness in the universe? In a universe with any randomness, determinism counters FreeWill; if there is not, the mere question of FreeWill is, in itself, irrelevant.**\n\n//**You have yet to justify 'chaos defies perfection'.**//\n\n//**Saying that determinism counters FreeWill is a lovely bit of factorising that tidies things up marvellously, but both have yet to be proven or agreed upon, let alone be shown to counter each other. Is it not possible that FreeWill, determinism and randomness are not absolutes and that they combine to affect the outcome of events?**//\n\n**On the other hand, I personally believe in a truly deterministic universe. Therefore, there is space within my model of the universe for a 'perfect' God. Perhaps I just find it difficult to concieve of a 'perfect' God within the scope of the popular image of an 'imperfect' universe, and can't look past the argument that says that it is possible to be certain of the existance of 'one' and 'only' god when that god can't be (even theoretically) demonstrated to exist outside of time. The fact that, in my model, I choose not to believe in such a god, is also entirely pre-determined.

GarethHopkins\n----\nIf [[FreeWill free will]] is a 'figment of our imagination' then it is no more or less so than anything else we perceive. 'Figment of the imagination' is derogatory and implies some kind of misguidedness, invalidity or even childishness. I would prefer \"construct of the human '[[TheMind mind]]'\" - a definition which can be applied to anything you see, touch, smell, taste, hear, remember, think, etc etc... Since nothing exists outside our [[TheMind minds]] we have as much free will as we need, which is as much free will as we can subjectively experience. Even if you believe the theories which state that free will does not truly exist to be correct (which I do) then you cannot ever truly experience this to be the case as you perceive choices to be available to you and make them accordingly. The point at which a prediction could realistically be made, at a human level, would only be after the fact of you having made the choice, which isn't really a prediction. The prediction could only be made by what you might call '[[GodKnows God]]' - but that's effectively a different debate. The prediction would be made by something which underlay the universe on some level whether that was metaphysical, spiritual, psychological, neuropsychological or smaller. We are not beings which exist at such a level, we cannot perceive beyond our minds and our minds tell us we have free will.

Which, frankly, is a fucking miracle these days.\n\nKtErrington will also be voting Liberal Democrat because Labour can't viably be called left-wing any more. The Liberal Democrats would, if elected, increase taxation for the highest earners in Britain, actually ensure Britain meets it's targets under the Kyoto Protocol, start making friends with the UN and (I quote) \"forge a new relationship with the United States which is a partnership of influence, and not so subordinate as to appear subservient\". \nAnother Labour term and we'll be up to our eyeballs with 'the right to chose your children's privately funded school', none of which will be up to standard, some of which will probably specialise in nailcare and nothing else (and be given a grants for reaching their national targets in nailcare) and all of which will reflect the selling out of public services which should be an automatic right for everyone. I don't want the right to chose, I want every single school and hospital to be of a great standard, so that I don't have to shop around like someone searching for a Marathon bar and finding only Snickers. It's a right-wing policy for a right-wing government, and I think they've had their day.\n\nJonAtkinson wonders why people believe anything any party says. They're all liars, end of story. For fucks sake, don't vote on what is promised, vote on the economic issues, they're really all that matter.\n\nMattInTheHat likes their national policies but due to the way the political system of the [[UnitedKingdom UK]] works he will need to contact his local representative and find out their personal views and in what way (if any) they differ from their party's. This is less of an issue than it is in America due to the tighter cohesion within the political parties in the UK as compared to the US (e.g. during GeorgeWBush's presidential election campaign he said that he had not read the Republican Party Platform {basically a manifesto}: can you imagine any politician in the UK saying that?). Also less of an issue since MattInTheHat doesn't have a (legal) vote in the US elections. See also MattInTheHatsViewsOnTheParties\n\nClaireMelton is a member of the Liberal Democrats and will be voting for them. The mere fact that they've not been in power in my lifetime means their policies are about what makes sense, rather than what will win votes, as they are resigned to the fact that they'll never win. If they do get in they'll eventually become as corrupt as the two major parties, but for a while it will be great.\n\nMattPayne is currently an undecided voter in Aberystwyth, having registered to vote here with the intention of originally voting for the LiberalDemocrats.  From where he comes from he would vote for them without hesitation.  But then his home seat of BirminghamEdgbaston, was a safe Conservative seat until 1997 and is reasonably safe Labour seat, the LiberalDemocrats always come a very poor third.  He refuses to vote for Vanitas/Veritas, who are also standing in Ceredigion, he dislikes the Conservatives on the large majority of policy issues and Labour do not stand a chance in Ceredigion and MattPayne distrusts them and their policies.  He has no qualms about the PlaidCymru candidate Simon Thomas who has done a decent job and thinks PlaidCymru do actually stick up for Wales whereas the other parties get swamped by London.  He may toss a coin to decide but any reasonable debate anywhere will be helpful.\n\nUpdate: The LiberalDemocrats won the constituency of Ceredigion taking it away from PlaidCymru with only a 219 vote majority.

This is why it sounds \"warmer\"\n\nIt's closer to real life, being an imitation rather than an interpretation -- and in two hundred years we'll have much better chance of being able to play back our analogue records than our CDs and DAT tapes.

In ROM, except for the A1000\nWorkbench - The user interface, invoked with the command \"loadwb\", although a good chunk of it loads anyway to give you the CLI. On disk.\n\nAny workbench version can be used as long as it's major release (number before the decimal point) matches that of the Kickstart\n\nNoteable releases:\n\n~- Kickstart 1.2 - Brilliant white opening screen showing a hand holding a disk. Catchy. Little hard drive support, but it was there. Workbench was a deliberate high-constrast thing of blue and orange. Quite painful to use, and no support to create a new directory. You had to duplicate an existing one. Also, deleted items *had* to be dragged to a trashcan. If there wasn't a trashcan on your disk, you couldn't delete. No commands in memory, not even CD. Two floppy drives or a hard drive essential if you wanted to do anything remotely serious\n\n~- Kickstart 1.3 - Almost identical, but it supported bootable hard drives.\n\n~- Kickstart 2.04 - Low contrast pleasant black/white/grey appearance. Boot screen changed to a purple animation of a disk being inserted into a drive. Introduced delete and new folder commands. Made a lot of commands resident, such as cd, so no need to keep reinserting the Workbench disk. Strangely, commands such as DIR were still disk-based. What most non-Amiga users will be familiar with, due to the popularity of the A500+ and the A600\n\n~- Kickstart 3.01 - Very similar in appearance to 2.04, but the changes under the bonnet were quite significant. Firstly was the support for cd drives, even bootable ones with 3.01 (as opposed to 3.0). Support for graphics cards like the Picasso (see later). Secondly was the introduction of \"datatypes\". This is essentially identical to the \"class-type\" idea on PCs, whereby a file _type_ could be assosciated with a program. Small moves... Moved a lot of boot-files to the ROM to increase speed\n\n====Guru Meditation====\nIf a software failure caused the Amiga to reboot, a flashing red box appeared with the phrase \"Guru Meditation\". This is supposed to be relaxing. The following codes described the error code and location in memory where it happened. Not much consolation to know that error 0x00000003 means divide by zero when you've just lost 12 hours work. Replaced by \"Software Failure\" with Workbench 2.04\n\n====Methodology====\nDevices and APIs were handled in a very dynamic way by the Amiga. Upon bootup, a variety of directories would be checked:\n\nThe C directory, contained commands which could be called from the command line. The default path would point here\n\nThe DEVS directory contained drivers for devices (not hard or floppy drives) which might be connected. They had catchy names such as cd.device or scsi.device\n\nThe L directory contained disk-validator, a file used to check integrity of the disk. Luckily this silly idea was abolished with Kickstart 2.04\n\nThe LIBS directory contained the API for the OS. Some were fairly sensible, such as ARP.library (later ASL.library) (the GUI), and powerpacker.library (for on the fly decompression), to the bizarre mathieeeedoubbas.library and mathieeeedoubbtrans.library (maths functions, I presume)\n\nThe S directory contained the catchily-named startup.sequence which was a script called upon bootup\n\nThe T directory was always a mystery to me since I never found anything in it\n\nThe Amiga never used extensions to identify filetypes. Instead, it relied on the application checking the first few bytes of the file before using it. Hey, it worked. Once datatypes were introduced, the OS could identify and assosciate files on the same principle\n\nThis does mean that executable files had to be tagged as such (with the X flag) otherwise the OS would not know they weren't data files\n\nAnother flag was the S tag, which meant the file contained a list of commands (like a batch file) to run. If you didn't set the flag, you could still treat a file as such with the EXECUTE command\n\nNative support for PC disks (double density only)\n\nThe Amiga uses the same CR/LF format as Unix, so there is no problem reading ASCII files. A tool called Crossdos could be invoked to run in the background (like a daemon or TSR), which would silently convert the end of line characters for you. Wasn't that nice? It also uses Unix backslashes, and many of the commands have similar attributes and names.

It comes in three parts ([[Zork]] I, [[Zork]] II, and [[Zork]] III), and features several awful puzzles (such as the \"diamond floor\" room, the carousel, and the loud room), and several mazes in the confusing style that was traditional for adventure games of it's age. It invented the [[Grue]], which would eat the adventurer if they spent too long wandering around in the dark, and this character was later parodied in many other adventure games, including by the modern [[Zork]] games. It's not possible to call yourself a serious InteractiveFiction player without ever having played [[Zork]].\n\nIt's now free to download: [[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/download.html get it here]].\n----\nFollowing the success of the original [[Zork]] trilogy, the series was extended (in both directions) in later years, with games like ZorkNemesis, BeyondZork, [[ZorkGrandInquisitor Zork: Grand Inquisitor]], ZorkQuest and [[ZorkQuest2 ZorkQuest II], ZorkZero, [[Sorcerer]], the [[Enchanter]] series, [[Spellbreaker]], SpiritWrak, [[ZorkTheUndiscoveredUnderground Zork: The Undiscovered Underground]], ReturnToZork, [[Wishbringer]], and [[Balances]]. Not to mention the stuff contained in the NewZorkTimes. The entire genre has been parodied by games such as [[Dork]].\n----\nPart of CategoryHomeComputerGames"},{"tag":"InteractiveFiction","body":"==== InteractiveFiction ====\n\nInteractiveFiction games, or \"text-based adventures\", are graphically-simplistic, typically turn-based stories in which the player performs the actions of the main character, or characters, by typing commands at thier keyboard. Early InteractiveFiction, such as the respected \"original\" [[Adventure]], could only handle simple commands, such as \"GO NORTH\", or \"PICK UP AXE\"; but thanks to improved string parsing, greater memory limits, and better ArtificialIntelligence algorithms, have led to dramatic improvements. Even [[Zork]], which was (originally) written in the late seventies, could (by it's later incarnations) accept commands of the form of \"OPEN THE CHEST, TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF IT, THEN GIVE THE AXE TO THE DWARF AND TELL HIM TO CLOSE THE DOOR\". Of course, it's not possible to cover every possibility, but for many players, part of the fun of a new adventure game is learning how to best interface with it. Some games even make a game of this, using clever language and puns to disguise the true nature of a particular puzzle in a game.\n\nInteractiveFiction games require a reasonable level of imagination on the part of the player - as there are rarely graphics to convey a sense of what is going on, only text-based descriptions of the rooms and situations function as thier eyes and ears. Purists will sometimes claim that this provides some significant storytelling advantages over modern, graphical adventure games, citing examples such as \"A shiver runs down the back of your neck\" as notions which are hard or impossible to convey in a graphical environment.\n\nDespite what you might expect, there is still a significant online following in InteractiveFiction games, including annual competitions for InteractiveFiction writers. (if I can be bothered, I'll add some links here - [[DanHuntley Dan]])\n\nIf you're interested in giving InteractiveFiction a go, why not start with the stunning [[Photopia]], which is comparatively easy (playing time 30 minutes or so, even for a beginner), very well-written (it's make a great short story) and can be played entirely without having to make notes (unlike many larger adventures).

According to Forbes magazine in 2004, BillGates is the wealthiest person in the world, a position he has held steadily for many years.\n\nBill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington to William H. Gates, Sr., a corporate lawyer, and Mary Maxwell Gates, board member of First Interstate Bank, Pacific Northwest Bell and the national board of United Way. Gates went to Lakeside School, Seattle's most exclusive prep school, and later on went to study at Harvard University, but dropped out without graduating.\n\nWhile he was a student at HarvardUniversity, he co-authored with Paul Allen the original Altair BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 (the first commercially successful personal computer) in the mid 1970s. It was inspired by BASIC, an easy-to-learn ProgrammingLanguage developed at Dartmouth College for teaching purposes.\n\nGates married Melinda French on January 1, 1994. They have three children, Jennifer Katharine Gates (1996), Rory John Gates (1999) and Phoebe Adele Gates (2002). They live in a very large earth-sheltered home in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington. It is a very modern 21st century house in the \"Pacific lodge\" style, with advanced electrical and electronic systems everywhere. In one respect though it is more like an 18th or 19th century mansion: It has a large private library with a domed reading room.\n\nAlso in 1994, he acquired the Codex Leicester, a collection of writings by LeonardoDaVinci; as of 2003 it was on display at the Seattle Art Museum.\n\nIn 1997, Gates was the victim of a bizarre extortion plot by Chicago resident Adam Quinn Pletcher. Gates testified at the subsequent trial. Pletcher was convicted and sentenced in July 1998 to six years in prison.\n\n----\nFurther reading:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/billgates/\n----\nPart of CategoryComputerPeople"},{"tag":"ProgrammingLanguage","body":"A ProgrammingLanguage is a predefined method of describing the processes a computer should go through to solve a given problem.

The mixture, called a boiling, is held at this temperature until most of the water content is driven off as steam.\n\n===Pouring & Cooling===\n\nThe boiling is then poured out onto cold steel tables through which water is circulated to help the product to cool.\n\n===Colouring and Flavouring===\n\nColours and flavours are added to the boiling to match those ordered.\n\n===Lettering===\n\nAs the boiling cools it has plasticene like texture which enables our experts to build letters and logos using strips of colored toffee.\n\n===Completing the Boiling===\n\nThe letters and the outer case are all wrapped around a central core to make one huge piece of rock... weighing around 60 Kgs.\n\n===Pulling===\n\nThis large piece is now pulled out by hand to the thickness ordered. The thickness of the bars is constantly monitored so that all the finished bars will be the correct size and weight.\n\n===Rolling===\n\n...then is rolled on long tables. At this point each bar is around six metres long. There is still some heat in the bars, so they are still pliable. Much care needs to be taken to keep the rock straight.\n\n===Cooling & Cutting===\n\nAs the rock is rolled it cools and becomes hard and brittle and is eventually cut to the length ordered using special cutters.\n\n===Packing & Dispatch===\n\nFinally the rock is labelled and wrapped in cellothane. It is then packed securely for transport to our customers all over the world or taken straight to [[Blackpool]] shops when it is sometimes still warm when put out on the shelves.\n\n===The Final Result===\n\nAnd here is the final result, exactly what you see when you bite into our rock candy.

The game revolves around the concept of a non-existant sticker album. The object of the game is to collect ugly people and put them into your non-existant album. Rules do, however, apply:\n\n* You can only call females, unless the person is a well-known figure, in which case males are allowed.\n* You can't call anyone over the age of your own grandmother\n* Or, indeed, younger than your youngest sibling (if you have none, say about 14 years old).\n\nThe method of playing the game is simple. While you're walking around, and you see an ugly (or odd, poor, homeless, chav-ish etc) person, you have to be the first person in your group of players to call that person and 'give' them to another player to put in their album. You need to call people in a certain way, however. The two phrases considered acceptable by the International Yours Foundation include:\n\n* \"Yours!\"\n* \"That one's yours, mate.\"\n\nOther local variations apply (we at the International Yours Foundation would like to see a localised Welsh version, for example), but in competition these are currently the only acceptable means of assigning points.\n\nThe game is scored in a fairly loose manner. The person who is currently 'winning' is often the person who called the most recent ugly person. In other situations, the leader is the person who has called the most ugly people that day. In situations where all players spot the same person at the same time, it is the person who manages to shout the phrase fastest or loudest who takes the lead. Bonus points can be gained by calling the person from within earshot; if you can manage to call a person from right next to them, you take the lead. This, of course, runs the risk of the other players spotting that person first. This can lead to exciting games where reflexes are the key.\n\nNow, for some examples.\n\n{{image url=\"http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat35.jpg\"}}\n\nThis one is yours. Note the overweight nature of this beast, along with the terrible clothes and badly chosen glasses.\n\n{{image url=\"http://www.riftweak.com/files/OH%20MY%20GOD%20UGLY%20GOTH!!!.jpg\"}}\n\nThis one is also yours. In this case, she is both ugly, fat, AND odd. This monster scored highly.\n\n{{image url=\"http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~jpfo/photos/chavstock/chav_010-r.jpg\"}}\n\nThis foul stain also scored well. Burberry gains extra points, as due to the aggressive nature of the chav, calling one in it's natural habital (pictured here at the watering hole) can result in fisticuffs.\n\n{{image url=\"http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat227.jpg\"}}\n\nThis is an example as a male yours. Prescott scores big points due to his fame and aggressive northern boorishness. Calling Prescott in the street would very probably promote you to the current 'winner'. \n\n{{image url=\"http://www.beerandspeech.org/images/041019/chav.jpg\"}}\n\nThis would be a stunning call. Note the gold chains, excessive make-up and clear social deprivation.\n\n{{image url=\"http://i.somethingawful.com/cliff/ihateyou/page-263/image-06.jpg\"}}\n\nOne of these ladies is 'yours', one is not.

OrphanedPages are WikiPages which are not linked to by any other page on the wiki. Some extend this definition to include orphaned clusters: selections of pages which are not linked to from anywhere else in the BigCloud, but link to one another. Parts of the debate follow. Please feel free to chirp in with suggestions:\n\n----\n**PaulMann suggests a way to prevent OrphanedPages**\nI have a suggestion for RockMonkey, which I'll leave here for people to peruse in the morning, or whenever. *cough*. Make it so whenever the \"edit\" script is accessed, the referrer is checked, and the edit page only appears correctly if it was accessed by clicking on a WikiWord, rather than typing theaddress in manually. That should greatly remove the number of OrphanedPages which seem to be appearing at a rapid rate, largely thanks to MilfordCubicle.\n----\n**DanHuntley picks holes in PaulMann's argument, and suggests a bad alternative**\nNice idea, but won't work with browsers that hide referrers (many installs of ZoneAlarm do this when jumping trans-site, so people only see \"local\" referrals), and, more importantly, won't work if user came directly to page (which is common for me, because I find out about RecentChanges by [[RSS]] andjust \"jump in\", and sometimes by WikiGame developers).\nIn addition, WikiGames may suffer, as it's very difficult or impossible to write code that will detect, for example, wiki links which only appear as a result of tokens or are full (http://...) links, so if you used one of these you'd likely be denied from changing the resulting page.\n\nBut you're right about the OrphanedPages situation, [[PaulMann Paul]]. Perhaps there's another way...\nWe could make it, for example, such that: \"If you own more orphaned pages than anybody else, and this is more than X (3?), you may not edit pages other than orphaned pages\". This will result in people having to reduce the number of orphans they're responsible for before they can do other edits, and by doing so, they become second-worst for it, making somebody else the OrphanMaster, until all active members have less than X OrphanedPages.\n\nHowever, again, there's a problem as far as the linking structure is concerned. A page which only contains a link to a category page appears orphaned, but is not, and a page linked to only by WikiGame code (e.g.some of TromaNightAdventure/RestlessWorld's dead scenes) appear orphaned, but are not under the correct (tokens/items) circumstances.\n\nPlus, an almost equally-big problem to orphaning is seperation from \"The BigCloud\", small clusters - usually of just two [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] - of pages that are connected to one another but to nothing else.\n\nWhile not technically orphans, they contribute equally little to wiki structure.\n\nSuggestions welcome.\n----\n**RuthVarley pitches in despite being only a junior grade geek**\nWell, it would probably help if everybody just read this page, felt guilty, and went away to fix orphaned pages they knew they'd created in the past...\n----\n**DanHuntley backs up [[RuthVarley Ruth]]**\nI'd love to see things work based on community-lovey-ness and respect for one another and for the wiki. But that's not likely to happen, is it. I'm never a fan of saying this, but a technical solution may actually be the best answer.\n\nPerhaps we could make it impossible to make a page unless a link exists to it already? But we'd still have the wikigame/category problems, potentially.\n----\n**RestlessBoy adds his two cents**\nMaybe we could just acknowledge that the whole of RockMonkey is just something a very small number of people use for pissing around having fun when they're bored and that it doesn't really matter if some pages get lost on the way, or if [[Watermelon]] links to [[Kangaroo]]. It's not like anyone really uses this as a serious info resource. The WikiGames are the biggest chunk of it volume-wise and most of the rest is just for people to take the piss (see [[Daventry]]).\n----\n**DanHuntley sits on the fence a little longer**\nAye, I agree with RestlessBoy. The OrphanedPages problem is not such a problem as one might expect, compared to the [[BadPagesNoLinks dead-end pages]] and the (awful) [[BadPagesNoContent content-less pages]].\n\n[[Watermelon]] and [[Kangaroo]] are part of the BigCloud. =o)\n----\n**JimmyCarter adds a little aside**\nWould it be possible to represent the big cloud/ little clouds in some sort of diagram, showing how many pages are in each and the connections between them? I'm thinking of those [[http://research.lumeta.com/ches/map/gallery/index.html Internet Mapping]] guys here, but obviously on a much smaller scale.\n\nIt //might// help to track and shut down the errant clusters (doesn't that sound slightly Blade Runner-ish?), but it will look nice and pretty.\n----\n**DanHuntley answers**\nYes, it's possible.\n\nYes, I'd love it to happen.\n\nNo, I don't have the time or inclination to write the program. But I'll lend all the support I can to anybody who does. Perhaps some young geek might like to have a stab at the project over the summer. Just tell me if you're interested and I'll tell you what it'll entail.\n----\n**RuthVarley gets all enthusiastic**\nOoh, ooh, I want to do it!\n\num... how?\n----\n//Your Suggestion Here//\n----\nSee also WhyOrphanedPagesAreAProblem\n----\nCategoryWiki"},{"tag":"PassThePageTwo03","body":"This all happened in TheFlat, which is quite remarkable, because the demolition crew had already started destroying it."},{"tag":"ThisSpace","body":"Watch it...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... wasn't that a nice space?\n\n\n----\n\nSee TotalBollocks"},{"tag":"JimmyCarter","body":"The thirty-ninth president of the UnitedStatesOfAmerica. \n\nCarter- full name James Earl Carter Jr.- was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Son to a peanut farmer, he managed to rise from these humble beginnings and become president. He had high aspirations- he wanted to make government \"compassionate and competent\", and help out the people of his country any way he could.\n\nUnfortunately he is mostly remembered for causing a recession, but he had a tough gig in regards to the economic situation at the time, and without his help [[UnitedStatesOfAmerica America]] would have come out of it a lot worse off.\n\nHis foreign policies were more progressive than others that have come before or after him. Despite rubbing the powerful [[USSR]] up the wrong way with regards to his views on human rights, he still managed to pursue nuclear limitation treaties with them, open up full diplomatic relations with [[China]], and helped the peace process in the MiddleEast by way of the Camp David agreement. On a side note, his administration was the one who trained Afghani rebels to fight the [[USSR Soviet]] invasion, including a young and eager OsamaBinLaden. But hey, everyone makes mistakes!\n\nA lot of people remember that Iran hostage crisis that consumed the last 14 months of his term, but not many people know that he (and his administration) were the ones who finally got the US hostages free- on the day JimmyCarter walked out of office, the hostages were sent home. \n\nPersonally I think JimmyCarter was a good man, who came to power in difficult times (both internationally and internally) and did the best he, or indeed anyone, could have done.\n\n\n----\n\nJimmyCarter is also a first-year [[Physics]] student at UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth.

For example [[AndyRegan AndrewRegan]] is a suitable name (Regan being a girl's name) but he is not famous enough. [[http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/CategoryFamousPeople FamousPeople]] can include, pop stars, footballers, TV/Film stars, writers, scientists... basically use your common sense.\n\nAs an example LukeTaylor of [[Aberystwyth]] band TheHotPuppies is not allowed, whereas StuartDavid, former bassist of chart act BelleAndSebastian is.\n\nYou cannot have MacSomethings, O'Somethings, SomethingSons or first names with an S on the end i.e. JulieAndrews - unless they can also be used as first names. i.e. HarrisonFord justifies GeorgeHarrison.\n\nThe name has to be spelled exactly - so you can't justify AinsleyHarriot because Harriet is a first name.\n\nPseudonyms/noms de plume/stage names are allowed - for example BobDylan. You can also use them to justify other choices. You can also use the real names of people who use pseudonyms - meaning you can have both EltonJohn and RegDwight.\n\nYou can't use people who are known by only one name. So for example you can't justify NeilMorrissey by referring to [[Morrissey]] from TheSmiths, cos his name is StephenMorrissey.\n\nYou can't have BoyGeorge. You just can't.\n\nFictional Characters are **not** allowed. So no ClarkKent.\n\nIf you pick a name with a potentially contentious surname - for example ChrisRock, you may wish to justify it by referring to another famous person in brackets afterwards - for example RockHudson. \n\nYou cannot use a fictional character to justify a choice. For example you cannot use FoxMulder to justify MichaelJFox. \n\nAnyone can ask any other player to jusitfy a choice, if they feel the person is making the name up, or that the surname is not a real first name, by putting 'justify?' next to it. They should then deduct a point for that name until it is justified. If it isn't justified the person loses the point and the name is removed. RestlessBoy's decision is final in all disputes.\n\nIt is best to pre-emptively justify names by putting:\n\nChrisRock (RockHudson)- comedian (RestlessBoy)\n\nYou don't have to justify every name. If it's obviously a potential first name then it's fine.\n\n==Scoring==\n\nIf you want to play for points then put your name next to all names you add to the list. Add up your own points and add them to the [[CraigDavidGameScores Scores Page]]. If you cheat we'll catch you.\n\nYou get 1 point for every name you add to the list. If you are the first person to think of a given surname then you get 3 points. If you think of a famous person with a double-barrelled surname where all three names are first names then you get 10 points.\n\nThe game goes on forever so there will be no ultimate winner. The aim is to have the most points at any given time.\n\n==The Unenforcable Rule==\n\nJust use your brain to think of names. Don't just type something into the imdb and list everyone who comes up. This is cheating, there's no way of proving you did it but it's still cheating.\n----\nCategoryGames"},{"tag":"CraigDavidGamePlay","body":"====The CraigDavidGame====\n\n===The List===\n\nPlease list names in alphabetical order of surname, but leave CraigDavid at the top.
