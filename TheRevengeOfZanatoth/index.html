Having succesfully stolen the SceptreOfZanatoth and delivered it to [[PeterHain Peter Hain]], the people of [[Wales]] thought themselves safe from [[Zanatoth]]Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s tyranny as he was safely locked up in [[Cardiff]] prison in a room with a butch man called Mindy and an asylum seeker.

But... Shock Horror! Somehow he escaped and kidnapped [[PeterHain Peter Hain]]. 

You play the part of P.C. Jack Restless (who you also played in the [[RestlessWorld first one]], I just didn&#x27;t tell you...), whose job it is to find Zanatoth and rescue PeterHain before it&#x27;s too late...

DanHuntley: Stunning. Highly amusing, really well-thought-out. Clever, witty, and sophisticated. But enough about me... go play the game!</script>
