      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Elves walked the lands while [[Human humans]] still lived in caves and trees, for they are a very ancient race. These tall humanoids live about twice as long as humans, whom they tend to look down on as children. All elves are thin beings, with large ears and slanting eyes. They seem more graceful than [[Human humans]], and far more intelligent somehow. They are fearless warriors, particularly expert with longbows. There are a number of different Elven races, each sharing a common heritage, but very different from the others.

Black elves were originally renegades from the evil kingdoms of the Dark Elves, to whom they are related. They abandoned the forests with them, and helped build their underground kingdoms, but grew more and more horrified as the dark elves dabbled in fearful magic and demonism. So they fled the cavern cities and setlled in isolated areas away from other elven races, where they now live squalid lives alongside [[Orcs orcs]], [[Goblins goblins]] and other inhuman races. Like all elves they are tall and thin. Their skin is somewhere between grey and black in colour, their slanted eyes yellow and catlike. They dress in shabby clothes of outlandish design, and sometimes decorate themselves in a similar fashion, with bizarrely cropped hair and painted patterns on their faces. Their favourite weapons are longbows, but they have also become skilled with spears and curved swords. Some black elves are nomads, travelling the plains in caravans to trade their wares in isolated settlements. Others live in small villages themselves, hunting and farming on the ppor land. All black elves are distrustful of other beings. They will attack other types of elves on sight, but other beings will be treated neutrally, if not in a friendly way. They have no love for strangers, and are not averse to waylaying them for gold.

In the times before the rise of human civilization, the different elven races went their separate ways across the world. The taint of evil had split them into two factions. In the wars that followed, the side of good won, however, and their opponents were forced to retreat beneath the earth, leaving the forests to the Wood Elves. In time all memory of these evil tribes was forgotten. In the darkness of their subterranean world, though, the dark elves grew strong again, and their civilization developed. Over the centuries their physical form changed, and they became very thin and gaunt, with midnight-black skin and green eyes. Their mind developed too, and they became more and more evil. Their sorcerers began to rule them, and their culture became decadent with slaves, demon worship and grisly magical rituals, for they had perverted the ancient elven magic to their own ends. They have an inbuilt hatred of all surface-dwellers, and small bands of dark elves continue to raid isolated aras, burning and looting whatever they find. When on the surface they shield themselves under large, black, hooded cloaks. Below ground, however, dark elves look very different, dressing in bizarre ornate clothes and decorating their hair and bodies with strange patterns and colours. Their favourite weapons are still bows, though in the confines below they prefer long serrated knives, fashioned in strange metals and with powerful mkagic bound into them in jagged ancient runes. Despite their hatred of the surface world, the dark elves know they could never return to live there. But their hatred continues unabated, and their raiding parties will always stalk the [[Earth earth]], killing or abducting any they meet.

Not all good elves dwell in the lowland forests. Higher up, on the hills and mountainsides, Mountain Elves hunt in the snowy evergreen forests. They look very similar to wood elves, though they are shorter and not quite so thin. They dress in warm hides and furs, typically brown or white, and carry bows and long hunting-knives. They are excellent shots, and can hit any target 5 times in 6. They live off deer, rabbits and other woodland creatures, though they are careful to take only what they need. Mountain elves make their homes in small huts perched high up in trees, which offer protection from the ravages of snow wolves and other dangerous predators. Mountain delves are peaceful, rather shy beings, who do not concern themselves with the affairs of the younger races. They are wary of strangers, but will be helpful if treated with respect. If they are attacked, they will not hesitate to kill their opponents with a deadly volley of arrows.

The most common of all the elven races are the Wood Elves, who may be encountered in any large forest. They are friendly, peaceful beings who love nature and spend much of their time caring for plants, trees and the other denizens of the forests. They don&#x27;t much care for [[Dwarfs dwarfs]], because they are unable to understand how they can shut themselves away from the beautiful surface world. Wood elves loathe [[Orcs orcs]], [[Trolls trolls]] and the other inhuman races for their ugliness and their insistence on burning down forests and murdering innocent creatures out of hand. As far as [[Human humans]] are concerned, they are undecided. They know that some are their allies in fighting the forces of evil, while others are in league with the [[orcs]] and their foul ilk. If adventurers are friendly and respectful, wood elves will give them all the help they need. If they prove violent and destructive, they will not be allowed to take another step into the elves&#x27; domain. Wood elves prefer to dress in soft green clothes which allow them to blend with their overgrown surroundings. They are skilled in all the woodland crafts, and can track their prey in complete silence until they wish to strike. They are superb bowmen, hitting 5 times in every 6. In combat they will also use shortswords to great effect. They dwell in large hidden villages protected both by overgrown vegetation and powerful magic. The wood elves ensure that only those they trust can find their villages. All others who seek them will become lost and wander around without ever getting near them. In their villages the elves are ruled over by proud nobles, both great warriors and spell-casters, who rule fairly and justly over all the creatures of the forest.
