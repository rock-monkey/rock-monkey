[[DanHuntley Dan]]&#x27;s a big fan of good wiki etiquette, and so these pages are dedicated to helping people better undertand how to make this wiki better for all of us. Here&#x27;s a list of some of the things that make BadPages bad:

== This document is under construction. There&#x27;s more to come. ==

=== 1. [[BadPagesNoLinks No Links To Other Pages]] ===
Every WikiPage should have at least one, and ideally more, links (or potential links) to related [[WikiPage WikiPages]]. In order to help facilitate this, I&#x27;ve composed a [[BadPagesNoLinks list of pages that violate this principle]].

Plenty of cross-linking ensures a vibrant and exciting wiki community, which people can explore for hours without getting stuck &#x27;in a loop&#x27; or reaching a DeadEnd.

=== 2. [[BadPagesNoContent No Content]] ===
A WikiPage which is completely blank is even worse than one that has never been defined - it doesn&#x27;t appear in the WantedPages list. It&#x27;s surprisingly common to see people deliberately &#x27;blank&#x27; pages if they disagree with their content, even though that content can just be &#x27;rolled back&#x27; using the &#x27;History&#x27; link - far better to provide counter-arguments and update the content you don&#x27;t appreciate. Here&#x27;s a I&#x27;ve composed a [[BadPagesNoContent list of pages that violate this principle]].

=== 3. OrphanedPages ===
We currently have a problem with orphaned pages (those which are not linked to from anywhere else on the wiki) and subclouds (sections of the wiki not connected to the &quot;BigCloud&quot;). We&#x27;re [[OrphanedPagesProblem debating solutions to the OrphanedPagesProblem]].
