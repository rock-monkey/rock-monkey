=== North Beach ===
----
You are on the Southern part of North beach. There is no way up to the promenade from here, as a result of the sheer height of the sea wall. Further Southwest, you can make out the iron legs of the pier where they are embedded within the harder slate of that part of the beach. To the Northeast, the beach continues, arcing into a concave bay as it turns Northwards. You can make out the lights, to the Northeast, of the promenade hotels.
