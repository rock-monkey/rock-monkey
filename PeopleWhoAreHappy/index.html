[[RuthVarley]]: [[RuthVarley I]] am happy, because I am me. And [[MisterJTA JTA&#x27;s]] happy too, because I said so.
DanHuntley: I am happy. Can&#x27;t see a reason not to be.
SuzChilestone: i am happy. do i need a reason? i&#x27;m full of coffee and have new socks on. and just to copy ruth, AlecRichardson must be happy too, because why wouldn&#x27;t he be, he has a splendid girlfriend.
MattInTheHat is not happy but JenBanks is happy and hopes that MattInTheHat is happy. This list could also be found by taking the [[CategoryPeople list of people]] and subtracting [[FrustratedTypes people who aren&#x27;t getting any]].
[[ClaireMelton]]: I&#x27;m happy, exams over is part of it but mostly I&#x27;m just happy because I&#x27;m not sad about anything. For once I have nothing to worry about. (Not for long though)
FayeBromilow is very happy, because she has her very own RockMonkey.
KtErrington is happy because it&#x27;s her birthday soon, and because life is good and sweet while dried pinapple is in existence.
