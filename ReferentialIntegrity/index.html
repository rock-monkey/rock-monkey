In DataBase theory, ReferentialIntegrity is a bit like duct tape. It&#x27;s kept together by good tabular relationships, and can be broken by people deleting records without regard to the consequences.

For example, if somebody went into the back-end of the database and deleted a page, for example, &quot;ThePopeIsDead&quot;, this would cause a problem, because [[MisterJTA]]&#x27;s comment on that page was not deleted - it would be left &quot;in the ether&quot;, and would be impossible to correct (even by MisterJTA, who should be able to delete his own comments) without **another** trip to the back-end of the database.

Just an example.</script>
