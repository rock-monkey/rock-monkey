This allows it to sneak up on its prey by turning sideways so that it is invisible, then suddenly turning to face its hapless victim, which is then scared to death by the [[Splurg]]&#x27;s terrifying spiky visage and implausibly jagged mouth.

The [[Splurg]], having no digestive organs, is then unable to eat its prey.

If there is a point to all this, it is yet to be discovered.
