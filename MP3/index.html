    A lossly compression format.<br />
That&#39;s it. There is nothing more to it. It is not illegal to own or make them. It is not illegal to listen to them. It is not illegal to transport or swap them. Got that?<br />
The issue is what they actually contain. That&#39;s beyond the scope of this entry, although it is illegal in most of the western world to trade copyrighted material without royalty payments. It just so happens that MP3s are a handy way of doing this, due to the fact it reduces the file size<hr />Now the techy bit<br />
MP3 is an encoding and decoding algorithm held by the <a href="/Fascists" class="internal">Fraunhoffer Institute</a>. To use the official methods, a royalty fee must be paid. The MP3 encoder and decoder which come with Windows are official. The decoder in <a href="/WinAMP" class="internal">WinAMP</a> isn&#39;t. Because through a process known as reverse engineering it&#39;s possibly to make a different algorithm which does approximately the same thing. The LAME encoder is an unofficial encoder. In some countries such as the US (Thanks to the <a href="/DMCA" class="internal">DMCA</a>), you can&#39;t reverse engineer, and so it&#39;s <a href="/TechnicallyIllegal" class="internal">TechnicallyIllegal</a><br />
MP3s are headerless, so an MP3 file is just a stream of MP3 data with no discernable beginning or end (let&#39;s ignore ID3 tags for now)<br />
If you cap one with a Windows PCM (&quot;Wave&quot;) header, then you can use <a href="/DirectShow" class="broken internal">DirectShow</a> to play them back, which is how you can get MP3s to play on the likes of Windows 98 with no extra software. However, this seriously confuses devices like <a href="/IPod" class="auto-fixed internal">portable MP3 players</a><br />
