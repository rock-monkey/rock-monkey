They do things like paint over mouldy ceilings, and don&#x27;t bother providing more than one shower for a house with ten people in just cos they don&#x27;t &#x2F;&#x2F;have&#x2F;&#x2F; to. They also get really fussy about times when [[ImSorryIDontKnowWhoYouMean people]] leave properties cos they have to clean them, when the property was very very far from clean when said [[ImSorryIDontKnowWhoYouMean people]] moved in.

One of their properties is [[Maldwyn]] in [[Aberystwyth]].</script>
