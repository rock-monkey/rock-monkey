      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A woman who likes to have power over men (or, in the case of [[Lesbian]] dominatrixes (dominatrices?) over women) and tie them up and do interesting things to them.

(&#x2F;&#x2F;It&#x27;s dominatricies. In the same way that if you have two female executors of your Will &amp; Testament, they&#x27;re both executrices. Not to be confused with a [[CockatriceCreature cockatrice]], which [[Kill kills]] people on [[Nethack]]&#x2F;&#x2F; - MisterJTA) 

(PaulMann adds - not played it much, but I imagine a mirror should save you from that... and Basilisks for that matter) 

(DanHuntley adds - cockatrices kill by touch, so a mirror doesn&#x27;t help [if you&#x27;re wearing gloves, a cockatrice corpse makes a great weapon, though]: suppose a mirror would help against basilisks, though, if they existed in [[Nethack]])

(MisterJTA adds - I don&#x27;t want there to be [[BasiliskLizard Basilisks]] in [[Nethack]]. A) It&#x27;s hard enough already, and B) they&#x27;d only encourage HarryPotter.

(PaulMann retorts - I&#x27;m not sure what that was in HarryPotter, but it wasn&#x27;t a basilisk. Basilisks are small sand dwelling creatures. In fact... check BasiliskLizard and CockatriceCreature)

Is anyone else here worried that a page which started out with a heading that made RockMonkey look like every other cheesy-nudey site on the &#x27;Net has ended up as a small collection of [[Nethack]] trivia?

Nope.
