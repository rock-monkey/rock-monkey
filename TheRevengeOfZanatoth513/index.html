&quot;Special ingredient in it, you know&quot; he lisps as he hands it to you with a wink. The sparkler fizzles out and you take a sip. It&#x27;s actually very nice. 

A man at the other end of the bar looks you up and down then moves along a seat.
&quot;Nice Cocktail?&quot;

[[TheRevengeOfZanatoth560 Yes it&#x27;s very nice]]
[[TheRevengeOfZanatoth514 What&#x27;s it to you, faggot?]]</script>
