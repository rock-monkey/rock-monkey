people there eat big sausages made of real meat, and drink a lot of [[RealAle beer]].

it is a commonly held belief that ladies there are furry, but i can tell you on behalf of my lady friends, that this is just not true.

in [[Germany]], it is very rare that you see a fat person on the street. the fat people can all be found in [[McDonalds]], and similar establishments.

everybody there speaks german.
(Some speak Schwabien...) SchwÃƒÂ¤bisch is a dialect of german, and still counts as german.</script>
