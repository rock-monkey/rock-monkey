  <section>
    Alias of <a href="/MattReynolds" class="internal">MattReynolds</a>, since it was discovered that he, like <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a>, wears a hat whenever he can.<br />
<a href="/MattInTheHat" class="internal">MattInTheHat</a> has many hats. Usually seen wearing a black leather Australian hat. When wearing a trench coat and dressed in black he can bear a resmebelance to <a href="/BillHicks" class="internal">BillHicks</a>. (i know no one who looks less like bill hicks, at all, even if you took up smoking!! <a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a> xx (He has since taken up smoking, much to the disaproval of <a href="/KtErrington" class="internal">KtErrington</a>))<br />
His flat mate&#39;s girlfriend wants to shave his head for charity. He&#39;s not sure about this, despite having agreed to it earlier. It will certainly affect him in the <a href="/GYHABH" class="internal">GYHABH</a> campaign. <br />
I&#39;ve changes my mind, I think it&#39;s a crackin&#39; idea and what&#39;s more I have a plan, we should have a day of sponsored madness. You shave your hair, Sundeep do a sponsored silence and (If anyone will have me) I&#39;ll be a sponsored lesbian for 24 hours - <a href="/KtErrington" class="internal">Kt</a><br />
He also plays a lot of <a href="/NetHack" class="internal">NetHack</a>. See <a href="/MattInTheHatsBestGameOfNetHack" class="internal">MattInTheHatsBestGameOfNetHack</a>.<br />
However, he can&#39;t <a href="/WikiBridgePuzzle" class="internal">follow simple directions</a>. And he&#39;s <a href="/FromMongo" class="internal">FromMongo</a>. <a href="/ThePlanetMongo" class="internal">ThePlanetMongo</a>.<br />
He does many stupid things, especially late at night when he should have gone to bed hours earlier. He feels guilty after doing stupid things and hopes that people don&#39;t hold it against him.<br />
Hates three things:<br />
<ul><li> Rudeness</li><li> Poor arguments and crap reasoning</li><li> Odd socks</ul><br />
He loves <a href="/StandUpComedy" class="internal">StandUpComedy</a>.<br />
He&#39;s not dead yet.<div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Whilst i may not look like Bill Hicks it did provide a handy place to creat a link to his page.<br />
By the by, here's a list of people who look less like Bill Hicks than I do: Dan, Paul, Claire, Suz, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird and Kermit the Frog. Heh. Am now imagining Kermit the Frog dressed as Bill Hicks with a cigarette in hand and ranting that 'God is dead'.</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote></div>
