      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Alias of MattReynolds, since it was discovered that he, like PaulMann, wears a hat whenever he can.

MattInTheHat has many hats. Usually seen wearing a black leather Australian hat. When wearing a trench coat and dressed in black he can bear a resmebelance to BillHicks. (i know no one who looks less like bill hicks, at all, even if you took up smoking!! AlecR xx (He has since taken up smoking, much to the disaproval of KtErrington))

His flat mate&#x27;s girlfriend wants to shave his head for charity. He&#x27;s not sure about this, despite having agreed to it earlier. It will certainly affect him in the [[GYHABH]] campaign. 
I&#x27;ve changes my mind, I think it&#x27;s a crackin&#x27; idea and what&#x27;s more I have a plan, we should have a day of sponsored madness. You shave your hair, Sundeep do a sponsored silence and (If anyone will have me) I&#x27;ll be a sponsored lesbian for 24 hours - [[KtErrington Kt]]

He also plays a lot of NetHack. See MattInTheHatsBestGameOfNetHack.

However, he can&#x27;t [[WikiBridgePuzzle follow simple directions]]. And he&#x27;s FromMongo. ThePlanetMongo.

He does many stupid things, especially late at night when he should have gone to bed hours earlier. He feels guilty after doing stupid things and hopes that people don&#x27;t hold it against him.

Hates three things:
~- Rudeness
~- Poor arguments and crap reasoning
~- Odd socks

He loves StandUpComedy.

He&#x27;s not dead yet.</script>

By the by, here's a list of people who look less like Bill Hicks than I do: Dan, Paul, Claire, Suz, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird and Kermit the Frog. Heh.
