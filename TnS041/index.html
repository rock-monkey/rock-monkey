&quot;Hmm.&quot; The elf looks at you calculatingly for a moment. &quot;Well, we do get through a lot of salt  here.&quot;<br />
He seems to make up his mind about something. &quot;Rumour has it that the Queen has hidden a large secret stash of salt somewhere around here. The only person who knows where it is is the old wise-man who lives in the swamp. If you could find the salt, and bring some back for the people of this village, you would be richly rewarded. Do you agree?&quot;<hr />What now?<br />
