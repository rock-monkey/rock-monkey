The world has just ended, and you are standing before Anubis, god of the dead (yeah, turns out the Egyptians were right - who&#x27;d have thought it?). He&#x27;s just condemned you to spend eternity in the fiery pit. Why?

a) [[Test71 Because you lived a thoroughly disreputable life. Oh well.]]

b) [[Test72 He hasn&#x27;t got a reason. Everybody picks on you!]]

c) [[Test73 You called him a &#x27;dog-faced twat&#x27;. You didn&#x27;t know he was a god!]]

d) [[Test74 You couldn&#x27;t afford the bribe.]]

e) [[Test75 You asked him to. All your friends were going there.]]</script>
