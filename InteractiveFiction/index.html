    <a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a> games, or &quot;text-based adventures&quot;, are graphically-simplistic, typically turn-based stories in which the player performs the actions of the main character, or characters, by typing commands at thier keyboard. Early <a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a>, such as the respected &quot;original&quot; <a href="/Adventure" class="internal">Adventure</a>, could only handle simple commands, such as &quot;GO NORTH&quot;, or &quot;PICK UP AXE&quot;; but thanks to improved string parsing, greater memory limits, and better <a href="/ArtificialIntelligence" class="broken internal">ArtificialIntelligence</a> algorithms, have led to dramatic improvements. Even <a href="/Zork" class="internal">Zork</a>, which was (originally) written in the late seventies, could (by it&#39;s later incarnations) accept commands of the form of &quot;OPEN THE CHEST, TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF IT, THEN GIVE THE AXE TO THE DWARF AND TELL HIM TO CLOSE THE DOOR&quot;. Of course, it&#39;s not possible to cover every possibility, but for many players, part of the fun of a new adventure game is learning how to best interface with it. Some games even make a game of this, using clever language and puns to disguise the true nature of a particular puzzle in a game.<br />
<a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a> games require a reasonable level of imagination on the part of the player - as there are rarely graphics to convey a sense of what is going on, only text-based descriptions of the rooms and situations function as thier eyes and ears. Purists will sometimes claim that this provides some significant storytelling advantages over modern, graphical adventure games, citing examples such as &quot;A shiver runs down the back of your neck&quot; as notions which are hard or impossible to convey in a graphical environment.<br />
Despite what you might expect, there is still a significant online following in <a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a> games, including annual competitions for <a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a> writers. (if I can be bothered, I&#39;ll add some links here - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)<br />
If you&#39;re interested in giving <a href="/InteractiveFiction" class="internal">InteractiveFiction</a> a go, why not start with the stunning <a href="/Photopia" class="broken internal">Photopia</a>, which is comparatively easy (playing time 30 minutes or so, even for a beginner), very well-written (it&#39;s make a great short story) and can be played entirely without having to make notes (unlike many larger adventures). You can <a href="http:<em>www.scatmania.org/archives/2005/02/26/photopia/" class="broken external">download a copy from scatmania.org</a> (preferred - a nice installer for Windows users) or from <a href="http:</em>adamcadre.ac/photopia.html" class="broken external">this page</a>.<hr />Part of <a href="/ComputerGamePhilosophy" class="internal">ComputerGamePhilosophy</a>
