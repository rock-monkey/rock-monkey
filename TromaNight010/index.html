=== Shell Filling Station ===
----
You find yourself in the forecourt of the Shell filling station. People are filling up their cars with fuel. On the other side of a glass hatch, an attendant in his early twenties is becoming more and more frustrated with having to push stupidly-shaped items through the slot that seperates him from his customers. {{InvHasOne item=&quot;PaulMann&quot; text=&quot;Paul hums a chorus of &#x27;24 hour garage people&#x27;.&quot;}}

There&#x27;s a manhole-style hatch near the fire extinguishers. {{Test if=&quot;getToken(policeatshell) = 2 and getToken(policepranked) = 0&quot; then=&quot;\n\nThere&#x27;s a heavy police presence around the filling station. It looks like the onwer got wise to your scam.&quot;}}
