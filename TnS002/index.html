{{Test if=&quot;getToken(visMar) = 0&quot; then=&quot;You land in the marketplace, and hide the Squirrel-mobile under an abandoned stall. You agree to split up and search for the source of the distress signal, and your partner soon wanders off, leaving you alone.&quot; else=&quot;You are back in the marketplace where you originally landed.&quot;}}

The marketplace is a large, cobbled square with a stone fountain in the centre. Roads lead off from each corner, to the south towards a hill with an imposing palace on it, to the north towards some woodland, to the east, further into the town and to the west, into what looks like a swamp.

The square itself is lined with sagging wooden stalls, each one draped with brightly coloured cloth. They have slogans painted on them in glittering paint, you can see that the nearest one reads: &quot;Feeling Low? Remember Rainbows!!&quot;.
