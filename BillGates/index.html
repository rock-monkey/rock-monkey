William Henry Gates III, KBE, (born October 28, 1955), commonly known as Bill Gates, is the co-founder and current Chairman and <a href="/ChiefSoftwareArchitect" class="broken internal">ChiefSoftwareArchitect</a> of <a href="/MicrosoftCorporation" class="internal">MicrosoftCorporation</a>. According to Forbes magazine in 2004, <a href="/BillGates" class="internal">BillGates</a> is the wealthiest person in the world, a position he has held steadily for many years.<br />
Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington to William H. Gates, Sr., a corporate lawyer, and Mary Maxwell Gates, board member of First Interstate Bank, Pacific Northwest Bell and the national board of United Way. Gates went to Lakeside School, Seattle&#39;s most exclusive prep school, and later on went to study at Harvard University, but dropped out without graduating.<br />
While he was a student at <a href="/HarvardUniversity" class="internal">HarvardUniversity</a>, he co-authored with Paul Allen the original Altair BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 (the first commercially successful personal computer) in the mid 1970s. It was inspired by BASIC, an easy-to-learn <a href="/ProgrammingLanguage" class="internal">ProgrammingLanguage</a> developed at Dartmouth College for teaching purposes.<br />
Gates married Melinda French on January 1, 1994. They have three children, Jennifer Katharine Gates (1996), Rory John Gates (1999) and Phoebe Adele Gates (2002). They live in a very large earth-sheltered home in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington. It is a very modern 21st century house in the &quot;Pacific lodge&quot; style, with advanced electrical and electronic systems everywhere. In one respect though it is more like an 18th or 19th century mansion: It has a large private library with a domed reading room.<br />
Also in 1994, he acquired the Codex Leicester, a collection of writings by <a href="/LeonardoDaVinci" class="broken internal">LeonardoDaVinci</a>; as of 2003 it was on display at the Seattle Art Museum.<br />
In 1997, Gates was the victim of a bizarre extortion plot by Chicago resident Adam Quinn Pletcher. Gates testified at the subsequent trial. Pletcher was convicted and sentenced in July 1998 to six years in prison.<hr />Further reading:<br />
