Of all the frightful, terrifying and downright awesome beings that stalk the [[Earth]], none are as powerful as the dragons. Some say the race of Dragonkind is as old as time itself; there were certainly Dragons around to be recorded in the first histories of mankind. In the past the old civilizations were great allies of the Dragons, and they shared much knowledge. Young Dragons allowed themselves to be ridden by humans, even in battle, where their combined powers helped drive the armies of Chaos and Evil back under the ground.

Nowadays the old Dragons hide themselves away, sleeping out the millennia until civilization needs them again. Younger Dragons still stalk the [[Earth]], but many are evil creatures, concerned only with acquiring gold and treasure. In some of the newer kingdoms there are people who have never seen a Dragon, for they are now very rare creatures.

Dragons are the noblest of all reptilian races, gigantic winged creatures with long necks and tails. There are many subspecies, each with its own skin colour and other individual species. All Dragons can fly, and most can speak a wide variety of [[human]] and animal languages. Dragons are able to spit fire, acid or ice from their mouths. They also have claws and fangs; even without their fatal breath they would be more than a match for the strongest opponents. They come in different sizes and strengths, according to their age. Dragons seem to be all but immortal, and they mature only very slowly. Dragons are called young between the time they burst out of the egg and reach one hundred years of age, by which time they may have grown up to twelve metres long. They are impetuous, as Dragons go, and may be encountered in partnership with a powerful [[human]] such as a sorceror or evil leader who can provide both protection and regular food. Young Dragons do not know much of magic or books, as they are far too busy acquiring treasure to learn from wizards or converse with sages.

====Misconceptions====
~- Dragons are not always red
~- Not all dragons hoard treasure
~- Not all dragons are sentient
~- Not all dragons hate [[human humans]]
~- Not all dragons can breathe fire
~- Not all dragons are magical to the extent of Brass Dragons

====Life====
Adult Dragons are aged between one hundred and five hundred years old, and can grow up to about twenty-five metres in length. There are very few adults known to mankind, for they are very rare and spend much of their time sleeping on their vast hoards in cavernous halls deep below a mountain or castle.

Old Dragons have not been seen by anyone for many hundreds of years, and it is thought they may have left this earth to live on the MagicalPlanes in peace. For this reason there are no details of them in the following descriptions. It is very unlikely they will be encountered by adventurers on the EarthlyPlane.

The skin of a Dragon will easily fetch a pretty price, whereupon it can be used by skilled craftsmen to make superb armour. Actually acquiring the skin of a Dragon is another matter. Plus, it&#x27;s cruel.

A wet start to August usually means a good breeding season for Dragons, who will hatch sometime the following summer. Dragons have the curious habit of consuming foliage from chestnut trees where available, shortly after sunrise. Leaves consumed at this time do not travel down the normal digestive tract, but go instead into a second stomach set forward and a little below that which the Dragon uses to digest food. Here, in this second stomach, the leaves are converted into sedimentary layers of humus which, encouraged by the Dragon&#x27;s body heat, gives off vast quantities of methane gas. Once a Dragon is four months old, it develops crystalline extrusions on its upper fangs and a thin layer of natural metallic capping on the lower. The result of these developments is that when the dragon snaps its jaws together sharply, it produces a spark. This spark will normally ignite the almost continuous flow of methane from the second stomach, producing a the fiery dragon breath which is such a distinctive feature for those breeds which produce it.

====European Dragons vs Eastern Dragons====
When most people think of dragons, they think of the European dragon. However, the eastern dragon has deeper roots in mythology. Typically an Eastern dragon will be amiable to [[human humans]], whereas a European dragon won&#x27;t be. Eastern dragons also don&#x27;t usually have legs, and tend to represent earth spirits, such as water

====Common Types of Dragon====
**Black Dragons** are usually encountered in rough, hilly terrain, where they may be preying upon villages for their livestock or people. Both young and adult Black Dragons make their lairs in caverns, to which they will return after a day&#x27;s hunting. Younger creatures will have only a small, cramped cave, but an adult may occupy a vast cavern complex, housing a tribe of [[Goblins]] or [[Orcs]] as well as various other monsters, with several secret entrances for when danger threatens. Doesn&#x27;t breathe fire, but can breathe a cloud of poisonous gas. Young creatures can create one up to three metres in diameter, an adult twice that.

**Brass Dragons** have yet to be confirmed by many sources, for reasons given later. All people can agree on is that they are very bad news indeed. There have only been five authenticated appearances of Brass Dragons in the whole of recorded [[human]] history: two in Asia, one in Europe, one in Spain and one which turned up in Londinium before the Romans left. In every instance, the destruction wrought was massive. Three-quarters of Londinium was demolished or ravaged by fire, and seventeen of the very finest Roman Legions completely wiped out before the beast stupidly consumed the entire stock of an ale-house and drowned after falling drunkenly into the Thames. While the natural history of other breeds is relatively well known, no-one really has the last idea where Brass Dragons come from, what laws govern their abrupt appearance, or how to get rid of them when they do appear. Typically, a Brass Dragon will turn up out of the blue, run riot for several months or years, and then simply disappear (The Drowned Dragon of Londinium was unusual in the way it met its fate). No-one has ever succeeded in killing one. One reason for this noteworthy failure is that there is every indication Brass Dragons may be magical. 

The largest and noblest of all their race, **Gold Dragons** are only rarely encountered by [[human humans]]. They prefer to inhabit large towers or castles in the middle of deserts or at the top of mountains, well removed from most other creatures. They are better disposed towards [[human humans]] than other Dragons, though they cannot understand that their short lifespan makes them seem impatient and rude. Gold Dragons tend to be especially friendly with sages and sorcerors, who sometimes visit them with questions on ancient history and magic. The Dragons dislike the more primitive and violent humanoid races, though, and will normally attack them on sight. Gold Dragons can breathe a wide jet of flame, broad enough to hit two opponents. Creatures aged more than about seventy years may also have magical spells to back up their claws and teeth; they are particularly fond of illusions and tricks. The armoured hide of a Gold Dragon is very tough.

A young **Green Dragon** may be encountered amid the tangles at the centre of a large forest, where it will make its lair in an old ruin or a shallow cave in a hillside. An adult creature will only be encountered deep in a tropical jungle, well away from any settlements, where it can enjoy being the largest and most voracious predator in the region. Green Dragons are natural hunters, both quick and cunning, and make fearsome opponents. They can breathe out a thin stream of fire, adults causing more damage than youngsters.

**Red Dragons** are hoarders who relish collecting coins, jewels and all other valuable items. When encountered, a Red Dragon will usually be in its cavern, sprawled across the top of a large pile of treasure. Red Dragons are automatically suspicious of anyone they encounter, believing them to be thieves intent on stealing their treasure, and will attack them immediately. They can shoot fire-balls from their mouths, which they send roaring through the air to explode on their target, and can shoot them up to twenty-five metres with surprising accuracy. This is the type of Dragon most frequently portrayed in Western Fiction.

**Silver Dragons** have long been the arch-enemies of their Gold cousins, for they are very jealous of their status among the rest of Dragonkind. They seem to be perpeptually plotting against their noble relations, though events rarely get violent. Silver Dragons live in desolate areas away from other creatures, for they can be bad-tempered and aggressive. In an attack a Silver Dragon can shoot out a chilling sheet of cold that is wide enough to hit two opponents at once. Silver Dragons fear fire though, and would rather give away part of their vast treasure-hoard than face several creatures wielding it against them.

Of all the desolate, inhospitable places that Dragons inhabit, nowhere is worse than that of the **White Dragons**. They can only survive in sub-zero temperatures, so they will only ever be encountered amid the snow and ice of the extreme North or South. They dwell in vast caves or castles carved from the ice itself. They are the most unpredictable of all Dragons, and will normally eat any being they come across. In keeping with its frigid home, a White Dragon can breathe out a stream of ice that will freeze its opponent. A White Dragon will not eat its dead prey straight away. Sometimes, especially when the long winter draws near, they will leave the bodies inside large blocks of ice, to keep until other food is scarce, when they will claw them out and eat them at their leisure.
