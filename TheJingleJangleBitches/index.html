    <h4>The Jingle-Jangle Bitches</h4>Vague idea that <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> has which would require two or three girls with good (but definitely not great), and fairly high pitched voices - and another two or three girls who would be photogenic and could pose with guitars (they could, potentially, be the same girls). <br />
Would be an <a href="/ImaginaryBand" class="internal">ImaginaryBand</a> (the best kind of of band) with all the music and words written and played by me in the style of late 80s early 90s jangly indiepop but with some really harsh lyrics - no actual songs written yet. I would then post mp3s of their music on the <a href="/InterNet" class="internal">internet</a> and send their recordings to record labels and see what happened.<br />
Are you a girl? Can you sing but not really that well? Could you spare an hour or two to help record some sarcastic pop songs? Sign up below!!!<br />
Your Name Here!<br />
<a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a> will happily sing squeaky, that would make it all even more <a href="/ImaginaryBand" class="internal">imaginary</a><hr />Visit the <a href="http://www.paganwandererlu.co.uk/" class="broken external">Pagan Wanderer Lu</a> website<hr /><a href="/CategoryMusic" class="internal">CategoryMusic</a>
