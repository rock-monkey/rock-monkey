This is how it goes:<br />
<br />
A big, black, strong piece of road walks into a pub. He slams his tarmac fist on the counter and says &quot;Gimme a beer&quot;, interrupting the barman's friendly banter with one of the locals. The barman is about to protest, but when he looks at the piece of road's gravelly face, he thinks better of it and pulls him a pint. The big piece of road then saunters off into the corner of the room with his pint.<br />
<br />
Another piece of road comes into the pub. Again, big, slightly browner than the other piece, comes in, demands a pint, and staggers off to chat with the other piece of road.<br />
<br />
Third piece of road walks in. This one is significantly smaller, daintier, and pink. He walks up to the bar, and asks in a calm polite voice for a half of coke. As the barman is pouring it, he notices the other two cowering in the corner, absolutely petrified. With the pink piece gone, and feeling rather macho, the barman walks up to the more manly pieces of road and says &quot;Hey, why are you two so scared of that tiny piece of road? You two could pummel it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, are you mad? He's a CyclePath!&quot;</div><cite><a href="/AwkwardMatt">AwkwardMatt</a></cite></blockquote>

This is how it goes:<br />
<br />
A big, strong, throat sweet (a Halls Soother) walks into a pub. He slams his lemon-flavoured fist on the counter and says &quot;Gimme a beer&quot;, interrupting the barman's friendly banter with one of the locals. The barman is about to protest, but when he looks at the throat sweet's syrupy contents, he thinks better of it and pulls him a pint. The big throat sweet then saunters off into the corner of the room with his pint.<br />
<br />
Another throat sweet (this time from a packet of Tunes) comes into the pub. Again, big, slightly more flavoursome than the other piece, comes in, demands a pint, and staggers off to chat with the Halls Soother.<br />
<br />
Third throat sweet walks in - a Strepsil. This one is significantly smaller, daintier, and pink. He walks up to the bar, and asks in a calm polite voice for a half of coke. As the barman is pouring it, he notices the other two cowering in the corner, absolutely petrified. With the pink pill gone, and feeling rather macho, the barman walks up to the more manly sweets and says &quot;Hey, why are you two so scared of that tiny Strepsil? You two could pummel it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, are you mad? He's menthol!&quot;</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote></div>
