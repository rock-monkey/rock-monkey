    <h2>OperatingEnvironment</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    A term which isn&#39;t used much anymore, and leads to bizarre things like lecturers declaring that all of the following are <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">Operating Systems</a>:<br />
<a href="/Emacs" class="broken internal">Emacs</a><br />
<a href="/Java" class="broken internal">Java</a> Virtual Machine<br />
<a href="/MozillaFirefox" class="internal">MozillaFirefox</a><br />
<a href="/Windows" class="broken internal">Windows</a> XP<br />
An Operating Environment is a user-interface for an <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a>. The best example of which is Windows 95. It&#39;s actually DOS, with a nice happy graphical front-end for the user to work with. The actual <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a> is still DOS (Albeit DOS 7, which only shipped with Windows 95/8)<br />
A command-line is generally not regarded as an OE as you have to have some way of communicating with the computer<br />
Most <a href="/distributions" class="broken internal">distributions</a> of Linux are a combinational <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a> / <a href="/OperatingEnvironment" class="internal">OperatingEnvironment</a>, with your OE being <a href="/X" class="broken internal">X</a>, and that in turn being controlled by (typically) either <a href="/Gnome" class="broken internal">Gnome</a> or <a href="/KDE" class="broken internal">KDE</a><br />
OSs which don&#39;t have built in graphical OEs:<br />
Windows 95/98 (although it came with one)<br />
DOS (Windows 3.11 was sold as an OE)<br />
*nix (although it usually comes with one)<br />
<a href="/MacOs" class="auto-fixed internal">MacOS</a> X (although it comes with one)<br />
TOS (The <a href="/AtariSt" class="internal">AtariSt</a> operating system. Although it came with GEM on the TOS-chip, it was possible to boot without using GEM to save a few extra Kb of memory)<br />
There are very few OSs with a built in graphical OE. A few that spring to mind are:<br />
<a href="/MacOs" class="internal">MacOs</a> (Prior to ten)<br />
<a href="/AmigaOS" class="auto-fixed internal">AmigaOs</a> (Even though the default startup was a <a href="/CLI" class="broken internal">CLI</a>, the command &#39;loadwb&#39; did not start a seperate program, it merely invoked the menu/icon part of the GUI, since the mouse and windows were already running)<br />
<a href="/WindowsXP" class="internal">WindowsXP</a> (And <a href="/WindowsNT" class="broken internal">WindowsNT</a>) (Load one of these in &quot;command line&quot; mode, and it still invokes the GUI, albeit in a cut-down form)<br />
Of course, you could argue that they are &#39;graphical sub-systems&#39;, but then you&#39;re just being picky and would probably say that disk-access wasn&#39;t part of an <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a>. Loser.
