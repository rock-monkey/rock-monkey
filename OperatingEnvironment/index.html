An Operating Environment is a user-interface for an OperatingSystem. The best example of which is Windows 95. It&#x27;s actually DOS, with a nice happy graphical front-end for the user to work with. The actual OperatingSystem is still DOS (Albeit DOS 7, which only shipped with Windows 95&#x2F;8)

A command-line is generally not regarded as an OE as you have to have some way of communicating with the computer

Most [[distributions]] of Linux are a combinational OperatingSystem &#x2F; OperatingEnvironment, with your OE being [[X]], and that in turn being controlled by (typically) either [[Gnome]] or [[KDE]]

OSs which don&#x27;t have built in graphical OEs:

Windows 95&#x2F;98 (although it came with one)
DOS (Windows 3.11 was sold as an OE)
*nix (although it usually comes with one)
MacOS X (although it comes with one)
TOS (The AtariSt operating system. Although it came with GEM on the TOS-chip, it was possible to boot without using GEM to save a few extra Kb of memory)

There are very few OSs with a built in graphical OE. A few that spring to mind are:

MacOs (Prior to ten)
AmigaOs (Even though the default startup was a [[CLI]], the command &#x27;loadwb&#x27; did not start a seperate program, it merely invoked the menu&#x2F;icon part of the GUI, since the mouse and windows were already running)
WindowsXP (And WindowsNT) (Load one of these in &quot;command line&quot; mode, and it still invokes the GUI, albeit in a cut-down form)

Of course, you could argue that they are &#x27;graphical sub-systems&#x27;, but then you&#x27;re just being picky and would probably say that disk-access wasn&#x27;t part of an OperatingSystem. Loser.</script>
