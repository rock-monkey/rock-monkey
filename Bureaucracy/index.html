      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Dictionary.com offers one defintion of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] as &#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;An administrative system in which the need or inclination to follow rigid or complex procedures impedes effective action.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

RestlessBoy feels that [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] is one of the biggest inadvertant evils in the [[World world]] today, for these reasons:
~- It impedes [[Progress progress]] and gives power to people who want to get their way by bullying or boring others into submission. Or by making it too complicated for them to work against the system to better their own individual situation. This is often unintentional which makes it worse.
~- It values systems above individual judgement. 
~- It seeks to protect the wider public from potential flaws or errors of those in power but at the same time constrains those in power from making dynamic or innovative decisions with any speed, or sometimes entirely.
~- The very individuals who make the rules can more often than not hold up their hands and say &#x27;There&#x27;s nothing I can do, those are the rules&#x27;.
~- People spend ages making up the rules, often allowing things to pass them by. They invariably later find the rules to be deficient in some way.
~- It allows individual cases of suffering caused by the rules to be written off as [[Statistics statistics]]. 
~- In terms of government bureaucracy, entire groups of people can be left suffering whilst huge groups of CivilServants&#x2F;[[Bureaucrats]] discuss what can be done about their plight.

An alternative is to elect people who are trustworthy, adept, knowledgable, and with the right priorities to a positions of power. Make sure their actions are open to scrutiny and that they can legally and personally be held accountable for their consequences. Then let them get it on with it. 

The fact that [[Idiots TheGeneralPublic]] has lost faith in this idea is what allows [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] to thrive and perpepuates further shitness. Because [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] is given a human face means [[Wankers TheGeneralPublic]] can ascribe blame to that person for the results of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]]&#x27;s endeavour. This leads them to further believe that it is the person, not the system, that is at fault and call for further systems. 

&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;[[Capitalism]] doesn&#x27;t work, [[Communism]] doesn&#x27;t work, what we need is socialism under a benevolent dictator. Like SantaClaus.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

People who value systems over people should not be allowed to make decisions which affect people&#x27;s lives. (see also TheWarOnTerror)</script>
