  <section>
    Dictionary.com offers one defintion of <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">bureaucracy</a> as <em>&quot;An administrative system in which the need or inclination to follow rigid or complex procedures impedes effective action.&quot;</em><br />
<a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> feels that <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">bureaucracy</a> is one of the biggest inadvertant evils in the <a href="/World" class="internal">world</a> today, for these reasons:<ul></li><li> It impedes <a href="/Progress" class="internal">progress</a> and gives power to people who want to get their way by bullying or boring others into submission. Or by making it too complicated for them to work against the system to better their own individual situation. This is often unintentional which makes it worse.</li><li> It values systems above individual judgement. </li><li> It seeks to protect the wider public from potential flaws or errors of those in power but at the same time constrains those in power from making dynamic or innovative decisions with any speed, or sometimes entirely.</li><li> The very individuals who make the rules can more often than not hold up their hands and say &#39;There&#39;s nothing I can do, those are the rules&#39;.</li><li> People spend ages making up the rules, often allowing things to pass them by. They invariably later find the rules to be deficient in some way.</li><li> It allows individual cases of suffering caused by the rules to be written off as <a href="/Statistics" class="broken internal">statistics</a>. </li><li> In terms of government bureaucracy, entire groups of people can be left suffering whilst huge groups of <a href="/CivilServants" class="broken internal">CivilServants</a>/<a href="/Bureaucrats" class="broken internal">Bureaucrats</a> discuss what can be done about their plight.</li></ul>An alternative is to elect people who are trustworthy, adept, knowledgable, and with the right priorities to a positions of power. Make sure their actions are open to scrutiny and that they can legally and personally be held accountable for their consequences. Then let them get it on with it. <br />
The fact that <a href="/Idiots" class="broken internal">TheGeneralPublic</a> has lost faith in this idea is what allows <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">bureaucracy</a> to thrive and perpepuates further shitness. Because <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">bureaucracy</a> is given a human face means <a href="/Wankers" class="broken internal">TheGeneralPublic</a> can ascribe blame to that person for the results of <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">bureaucracy</a>&#39;s endeavour. This leads them to further believe that it is the person, not the system, that is at fault and call for further systems. <br />
<em>&quot;<a href="/Capitalism" class="broken internal">Capitalism</a> doesn&#39;t work, <a href="/Communism" class="broken internal">Communism</a> doesn&#39;t work, what we need is socialism under a benevolent dictator. Like <a href="/SantaClaus" class="internal">SantaClaus</a>.&quot;</em><br />
People who value systems over people should not be allowed to make decisions which affect people&#39;s lives. (see also <a href="/TheWarOnTerror" class="broken internal">TheWarOnTerror</a>)
