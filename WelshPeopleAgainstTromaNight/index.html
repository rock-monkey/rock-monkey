    <h4>In Fiction</h4>The <a href="/WelshPeopleAgainstTromaNight" class="internal">WelshPeopleAgainstTromaNight</a> are a fictional group featured in the <a href="/TromaNightAdventure" class="internal">TromaNightAdventure</a> <a href="/WikiGames" class="internal">WikiGame</a> by <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>. In the game, they kidnap <a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">RuthVarley</a> and tie her up <a href="/Pantycelyn" class="internal">Pantycelyn</a>. She must be rescued by the player in order to win the game with the highest possible score. There are two possible ways to do this, but the way which involves the player more directly is worth a greater number of points, and grants access to an otherwise unobtainable item, although it does require greater preparation and carries a greater risk.<br />
The group also features in <a href="/TromaNightAdventure2" class="internal">TromaNightAdventure2</a>, the sequel to the aforementioned game. Their role in this has not yet been made public.<h4>In Reality</h4>The <a href="/WelshPeopleAgainstTromaNight" class="internal">WelshPeopleAgainstTromaNight</a> do not exist. They&#39;re only believed in by certain <a href="/ConspiracyTheory" class="broken internal">conspiracy theorists</a>, and there is no evidence to substantiate their claims. That is all. <a href="/Fnord" class="internal">Fnord</a>.
