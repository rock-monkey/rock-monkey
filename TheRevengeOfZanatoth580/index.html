Ernest sits back and watches as you expertly work the chocolate penis with your mouth. His expression changes to one of pant-wetting amazement. Gradually you realise that all eyes in the room are on you as the chocolate melts and you guzzle its stickyness down your eager throat. Then you withdraw the worn down shaft and hold it aloft. The Sailors applaud you.

&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; says Ernest &quot;You wait and see. Remember what I said any sailor in town will do **anything** for you now.&quot;
