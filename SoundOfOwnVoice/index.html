    People involved in highly <a href="/Bureaucracy" class="internal">Bureaucratic</a> organisations tend to like hearing this. Such people will favour any long/tedious document/policy/rule over common sense/decency/other members of the organisation as long as the <a href="/SoundOfOwnVoice" class="internal">SoundOfTheirOwnVoice</a> was heard sufficiently often when creating it, normally reiterating the same thing over and over again in slightly different ways.
