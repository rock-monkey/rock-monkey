Not the case. Religious beliefs do not always demand FreeWill as a concept. - DanHuntley
True. Calvinism actually denies the entire concept. It says that since the &#x27;good tree bears good fruit&#x27; then God has determined whether you will live a good life or not by what family, status and standing you would be born into. - MattInTheHat

Also an abbreviation of the popular nineties film FreeWilly. GarethHopkins

If [[FreeWill free will]] is a &#x27;figment of our imagination&#x27; then it is no more or less so than anything else we perceive. &#x27;Figment of the imagination&#x27; is derogatory and implies some kind of misguidedness, invalidity or even childishness. I would prefer &quot;construct of the human &#x27;[[TheMind mind]]&#x27;&quot; - a definition which can be applied to anything you see, touch, smell, taste, hear, remember, think, etc etc... Since nothing exists outside our [[TheMind minds]] we have as much free will as we need, which is as much free will as we can subjectively experience. Even if you believe the theories which state that free will does not truly exist to be correct (which I do) then you cannot ever truly experience this to be the case as you perceive choices to be available to you and make them accordingly. The point at which a prediction could realistically be made, at a human level, would only be after the fact of you having made the choice, which isn&#x27;t really a prediction. The prediction could only be made by what you might call &#x27;[[GodKnows God]]&#x27; - but that&#x27;s effectively a different debate. The prediction would be made by something which underlay the universe on some level whether that was metaphysical, spiritual, psychological, neuropsychological or smaller. We are not beings which exist at such a level, we cannot perceive beyond our minds and our minds tell us we have free will. The level at which [[FreeWill free will]] can be proven emphatically to not exist is imperceptible and hypothetical - not to mention impractical. It is correct, but correct at a point of irrelevance. At least if you want to deal with people on the level of Being People. Rather than on some hypothetical philosophical plain underpinned by some transcendental grand narrative, which is other than God but no more realistic.  - RestlessBoy. 

What I was trying to say but better. - AndyKeohane

And, in fact, RestlessBoy - as I&#x27;ve always said: it &#x2F;&#x2F;all&#x2F;&#x2F; comes down to perception, in the end.
