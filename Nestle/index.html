  <section>
    <a href="/Nestle" class="internal">Nestle</a> are a large, multi-national, name-changing organisation who sell <a href="/Foodstuffs" class="broken internal">Foodstuffs</a> to people.<br />
What they also do is make powdered milk. They make lots of powdered milk. One day <a href="/Paedophiles" class="broken internal">paediatricians</a> started to tell people that breast milk was better for babies than powdered milk. They weren&#39;t just saying this; they had lots of impressive numbers and words with which to back it up. This left Nestle with lots of powdered milk that they couldn&#39;t sell to people in the <a href="/WesternWorld" class="internal">WesternWorld</a> because most of the ones with kids also had <a href="/Tits" class="broken internal">tits</a> too. So they started looking around for people who didn&#39;t know that powdered milk wasn&#39;t as good for babies as breast milk. They found them on a rather large continent predominantly populated by black people called Africa. Now parts of Africa are not as well developed in terms of infrastructure as the <a href="/WesternWorld" class="internal">WesternWorld</a> and so some people are less well educated and will believe, as most people will, anything told to them by someone in authority. Nestle went to some of these people and tried to sell them powdered milk but since they weren&#39;t <a href="/Americans" class="internal">a people who would buy any old tat simply to own it</a> they asked why they should buy powdered milk when it came out of their jubbly bits for free?<br />
This is where Nestle turn into <a href="/Bastards" class="internal">bastards</a>.<br />
They said that powdered milk was better for babies than breast milk in contravention of the <em>International Code of Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes</em>. Many people believed this and so bought the powdered milk. Powdered milk requires water to reconstitute it and in parts of Africa water can be hard to come by. Since the parents wanted their children to be healthy they would use what little clean water they had to make up an inferior substitute for breast milk to feed to their babies. This would leave the parents either without clean water or sometimes without any water at all and also, since they were no longer using their breast milk, they stopped lactating as well.<br />
Nestle&#39;s lies led to many deaths, both of children and parents, and also affected the development of the children&#39;s immune systems.<br />
The <a href="/StudentsUnion" class="internal">NUS</a> were one of the groups to actually do something when they heard about this rather than going &#39;meh&#39;. They banned all Nestle goods from Student Unions and wrote many petitions. The Nestle boycot is international and was first brought into effect in the US by <em><a href="http://www.infactcanada.ca/InfactHomePage.htm" class="broken external">INFACT</a>// but the problem was highlighted by the //War On Want// who are affiliated to the international group //SOLIDAR</em>, all of whom are areligious and apolitical.<br />
The problem is that Nestle are  big. Huge in fact. They won&#39;t care that a small group within society have banned the products of one of their divisions from a limited number of retail outlets that usually only have a select customer base anyway.<br />
Thankfully the point of a boycott is not to harm a company&#39;s profits but is a)to draw attention to the issue and b)to create a PR problem for the company. The <a href="/StudentsUnion" class="internal">NUS</a> boycott is clearly effective in this respect as most people reading this page probably first heard about this issue because of it.<br />
But Nestle are still bastards.<hr /><a href="/Wrong" class="internal">It should be pointed out that this account is not entirely correct</a>. Nestle said it was superior to breast milk with reference to the transfer of HIV from a breast feeding mother to her new born baby. The Anti-Nestle campaign people love to leave this little detail out which is stupid. It is why the <a href="/AntiNestleCampaigners" class="broken internal">AntiNestleCampaigners</a> are in fact the bigger bastards.<br />
Note the Anti Nestle campaign was as far as I&#39;m aware started up by Christian Fundamentalists who (amongst other things) believe that HIV is a punishment from God upon the wicked.<br />
<em>The Nestle boycot began in 1977 which is 4 years before AIDS was recognised and 6 years before HIV was was isolated from the blood. It was concerned solely with selling inferior and unnecessary products to a people through the medium of lies.//<br />
</em>The section regarding the boycot has been updated since this post. I couldn&#39;t find anything linking the origins of the boycot with Christian Fundamentalists.<em><br />
</em>As a point of information, by far and away the most common variant of HIV in Africa is HIV-2 which is not transmitted through breast milk.//<hr />From what I know of it, a large chunk of the Nestle boycott was got up by Quakers in the <a href="/UnitedKingdom" class="internal">UK</a>, which you&#39;d be bloody hard pushed to describe as &quot;fundamentalists&quot;...<br />
Also, I doubt fundamentalists would actually go to the trouble of boycotting Nestle in a bid to further the spread of HIV, because, mostly, they believe HIV is a punishment from God upon the homosexuals (who developed it first) so breast-feeding babies born after hetrosexual sex doesn&#39;t really come into it from that perspective.<br />
--<a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a><br />
<a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a> adds that there is no evidence that they &quot;developed it first&quot; - it&#39;s just that the HIV virus was first isolated in male homosexuals... This may have been a result of biased news reporting, since male homosexuals were the only population segment investigated at the time, because everybody thought it was confined to them...<hr />If I&#39;m wrong I&#39;ll admitt my mistake as can&#39;t find my orginal sources at this present time but, I think your wrong about HIV not being  recognised till 1981 though will agree with it not being widely known. I&#39;m not defending Nestle meerly saying I don&#39;t think its right to start campaigning on an issue when all the facts aren&#39;t clear.<br />
