      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Section of the dungeon in NetHack which is often dark and has no rooms and corridors, just a sort of space in which gnomes, dwarves and hobbits can usually be found. If you go down far enough there is the gnomish mine town, with overpriced food shops and an altar with a priest. Watch out for the watchmen, they don&#x27;t like it if you break things or try to pick locks. It is hard work, but worth doing, to get to the very bottom of the GnomishMines.
