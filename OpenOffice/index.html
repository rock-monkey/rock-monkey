    The <a href="/OpenOffice" class="internal">OpenOffice</a> was the brain-child of Erick van der Mothball, Professor of Applied Prevarication at UWA, famous for his experiments with chocolate teapots.<br />
He reasoned that, if you could find a place full of clever innovative people and build your office there, the clever innovative people would be unable to resist correcting your mistakes. He further reasoned that, if you made it easy for these people to get into your office, they would have a higher chance of noticing your mistakes.<br />
Carrying this logic to its extreme, he put his desk in the middle of a particularly busy corridor.<br />
The experiment fell flat on its face when all his expensive computer equipment vanished mysteriously. To quote the only person in the area at the time, one <a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonAtkinson</a>:<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really wierd. One minute it was all there, the next time I looked it was gone. Incidentally, do you want to buy a second-hand computer? I&#39;ve just got a new one.&quot;<hr />See <a href="/TotalBollocks" class="internal">TotalBollocks</a><br />
