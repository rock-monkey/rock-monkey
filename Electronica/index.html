      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">RestlessBoy - I&#x27;m hoping [[PaulMann Paul]] will define this for me properly.

I think this from Wikipedia will suffice for now:

&quot;Electronica is a rather ambiguous term that covers a wide range of electronic or electronic-influenced music. The term has been defined by some to mean modern electronic music that is not necessarily designed for the dance-floor, but rather for home listening&quot;

[[PaulMann Paul]] Personally I would say it angles towards the experimental side of electronic music (eg AphexTwin) as opposed to the pop-side (eg Erasure (sometimes), Pet Shop Boys, Thompson Twins, Soft Cell (sometimes)) which would probably be called either Synthpop or Techno (if you&#x27;re American)

The problem is that there is no clear definition.....

Electronica artists include:

AphexTwin
BoardsOfCanada
[[Squarepusher]]
[[Autechre]]
