~-The objective of WikiMaze is to guide your character, the FleebleWidget, through the damp corridors under PenbrynHalls, to the secret computer room where you can edit RockMonkey pages in peace. However, the terrible [[Splurg]] stalks these forgotten passages, ready to devour any unsuspecting victims.
~-You can choose your moves at will, but beware, because once you take a step you can never go back.
~-As you move around the maze, creative thoughts may besiege your mind. Please do feel free to edit the descriptions of the areas to make the game more atmospheric.
~-Watch out for [[Lesbians]] and [[HardCorePorn TubGirl]]. While rare, they can both cause instant death in the maze.

@@===About WikiMaze===@@
----
~-WikiMaze was created in about 2 hours. The old graphics were done using Paint, the newer graphics come from Dungeon Master Java, and the graphics are under the GPL
~-WikiMaze is based on a grid system. If you check the title of the node you&#x27;re at, you can find out where you are on the map. The first number is the x axis, the second number the y axis. There might be some areas that are unaccessible through normal play - search hard enough and you might find the cheat code!
~-That&#x27;s about it.
~-If you enjoyed WikiMaze, why not try WikiPlatformGame and WikiBridgePuzzle, two of the other WikiGames on RockMonkey.
