Work every hour [[God]] sends for a wage that is not quite enough for you to rise above your station but not quite enough for you to starve to death!

In addition you may then be able to BuyThings! From me! Meaning I get more of my money back and my employees, sorry friends, in the [[Government]] can get more [[Tax tax]] from you! Which then goes back into my pocket thanks to the lucrative PrivatelyFinancedHospital I am involved with!</script>
