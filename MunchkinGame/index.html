      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Munchkin is a custom card game by SteveJacksonGames, somewhat reminiscient of ChezGeek, and played at GeekNight. It is styled on RolePlayingGames, but with strange &quot;munchkinly&quot; rules. In the game, players try to [[Kill kill]] monsters and steal their treasure, and to backstab one another in the process. It requires a good deal of co-operation: particularly early in the game (like [[HackerGame Hacker]], also by SteveJacksonGames), and leads to some hilarious outcomes - &#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;Do not truffle with the humungous fungus!!&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;
