Yes indeed, you&#x27;re a fine, upstanding member of the community, someone whose dignity is only slightly spoilt by the great big scar down the side of your face. And what does your holiness say about you?

Well, your grace, if you&#x27;re someone who enjoys the odd [[Chess003 game of cards]] you&#x27;re a bit of a chancer, who likes a bit of paired teamwork to ensure all the ground&#x27;s covered and isn&#x27;t adverse to a bit of liveliness in your life.

If card&#x27;s aren&#x27;t so much your bag, you decided you were going to [[Chess002 read something]] you&#x27;ve shown yourself to be someone who isn&#x27;t always that patient, remains fairly analytical, and is quiet until you get bored of sitting about doing nothing - usually not that long - and decide you&#x27;re going to jet off over the board and waylay a few pawns. Or choirboys. Or both.

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
