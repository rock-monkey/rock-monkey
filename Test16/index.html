You are:

===The Inner Slob===

On the outside, you appear neat, organised and straight-laced. Social events are planned months in advance, and woe-betide anyone who pulls out at the last minute. However, somewhere in there is a lazy slob longing to escape. Maybe it&#x27;s time you gave in?

Your eldritch equivalent is:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;child possessed by demon (with extremely tidy habits).&quot;}}

You are most likely to turn into a demented serial killer if:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;someone accuses you of being badly organised (oops...)&quot;}}
----
You can post your result [[PersonalityTestResultsPage here]] to show the world. Or keep it to yourself and cry in a corner.</script>
