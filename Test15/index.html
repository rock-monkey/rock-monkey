You are:

===The Oasis of Calm===

You like a simple life, and tend to be well organised. This comes from the fact you are unbelievably mellow. You aren&#x27;t lazy, because that would eventually lead to a period of rushing around sorting things out, and rushing around is against your ethos. In the hectic party of life, you&#x27;re the one out in the garden, drinking G&amp;T in a hammock.

Your eldritch equivalent is:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;probably long since settled comfortably into the grave&quot;}}

You are most likely to turn into a demented serial killer if:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;hell freezes over. The demented serial killer thing is just too energetic.&quot;}}
----
You can post your result [[PersonalityTestResultsPage here]] to show the world. Or keep it to yourself and cry in a corner.</script>
