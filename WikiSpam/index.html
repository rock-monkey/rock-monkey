=== WikiSpam Discussion ===
RestlessBoy: Is this a new invention?
JonAtkinson: Not really. Wiki spam has been around for a while, and to quote from [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chongqed.org]], &quot;Some say any open content on the net is just asking to be spammed.&quot; Some good reads on the topis are avaliable [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.chongqed.org&#x2F;&#x2F;QuestionsAboutChongqing here]] and [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2.com&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;wiki?WikiSpam here]].

=== Measures Implemented ===
The following technical measures have been implemented to help to prevent WikiSpam from occuring on RockMonkey:

~- 3rd March 2005: Historical versions of pages now carry a &#x27;robots - noindex&#x2F;nofollow&#x27; tag. WikiSpam remains profitable even if a wiki is well-maintained and tidied, because the old versions of the pages (with the spam) are still accessibile by search engines. Now, search engines have been asked to ignore these old pages. This change will take several weeks to start having an effect.

~- 3rd March 2005: Added a spam blocker which tests for the sudden addition of a large number of external links to a WikiPage, and prevents it. If this trips anybody over making a legitimate change, they should leave a note on this page. This spam blocker would prevent all of the WikiSpam we&#x27;ve seen on RockMonkey to date.
----
=== Pages Affected ===

None at present, but is becoming an increasing problem.
----
=== WikiSpam Cleaning ===
How to help in the fight against spam on our wiki:

~- Check the RecentChanges page regularly, and if you find spam, act!
~- WikiSpam typically looks like a long series of off-site word links, usually at the bottom of a page, but can take other forms, too.
~- Change the page immediately, removing the WikiSpam. Leave a note on your edit (in the small text box at the bottom of the edit page) stating that you &quot;removed WikiSpam&quot; (this means that people using the RecentChanges list won&#x27;t feel the need to look at a page that hasn&#x27;t actually been changed, and helps us keep track of how bad the problem becomes).
~- If you find WikiSpam that for some reason you can&#x27;t change (no time, wierd permissions, etc.), edit this page and put the name of the affected page in the Pages Affected list, above.</script>
