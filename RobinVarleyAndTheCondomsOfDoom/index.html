      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">RobinVarley recently turned 16. For his birthday, RuthVarley bought him a birthday card (for which, see [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.electricquaker.co.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2005&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;anybody&#x2F; JTA&#x27;s Blog Entry]].

Into the card she put familial good wishes, and a small present.

The present comprised two Durex Extra-Safe condoms. Also known as the CondomsOfDoom, largely because RobinVarley ballsed things up in such a way that they &#x2F;&#x2F;became&#x2F;&#x2F; CondomsOfDoom.

During dinner at his boarding school up in the North, RobinVarley opened his card. And, so doing, dropped the CondomsOfDoom onto the plate of the person sat next to him. IE, the deputy headmaster. Who teaches him English. And who had a lesson with RobinVarley due the very next day. 

Apparently the deputy headmaster is famous for mocking people whenever he gets the chance.

[[RobinVarley Robin]] has thus cemented his place in the SedberghSchool Hall Of Nergs.

Apparently, [[RobinVarley Robin]] found the incident even more embarrasing than last year, when [[RuthVarley Ruth]] sent him a parcel from Amazon addressed to &quot;[[RobinVarley Robin]] &#x27;Small Irritating Child&#x27; Varley,&quot; which everyone in his boarding house saw.
