&quot;Freedom is what?&quot; You ask.<br />
The guard looks at you slowly, sizing you up. &quot;Well, you don&#39;t look like a spy...&quot; He seems to decide something. Tipping his helmet back, he looks straight into your eyes. You recoil from the pain there. &quot;Freedom is being allowed to be miserable.&quot; He tells you.<br />
You want to ask what&#39;s going on here, but before you can say anything else, the elf leans closer and speaks to you again. &quot;I have to go now, my life is in danger. If you know what&#39;s good for you, squirrel, you&#39;ll get out of here.&quot;<br />
With that, he&#39;s gone, tapping a section of wall and disappearing into the hole that appears.<hr />What now?<br />
