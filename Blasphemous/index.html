If you&#x27;re going to do this properly, be aware that it&#x27;s actually harder than it sounds. By and large, people seem to agree that shouting &quot;Jesus Buggery Christ&quot; is blasphemy, which is fair enough. But they also seem to think saying &quot;God All-sodding Mighty&quot; is blasphemous, which it isn&#x27;t. 

Jesus&#x27; name can be taken in vain, because people know what it is. God&#x27;s name, however, is some variation on &quot;YWH,&quot; with some vowels shoved in. This is because the people who first wrote the name of God didn&#x27;t want to put the vowels in, because they&#x27;d catch Hell for it...

It&#x27;s probably Iehova. Or Jehova. Or Yaweh. But, frankly, shouting &quot;O Jehova-fiddly-piss!&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite roll off the tongue.

Trust an all-powerful deity to take all the simplicity out of sin, eh?</script>
