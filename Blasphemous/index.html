    <h2>Blasphemous</h2>

  <section>
    Taking the name of <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> in vain. All the <a href="/BrynSalisbury" class="internal">CoolKids</a> are doing it nowadays.<hr />If you&#39;re going to do this properly, be aware that it&#39;s actually harder than it sounds. By and large, people seem to agree that shouting &quot;Jesus Buggery Christ&quot; is blasphemy, which is fair enough. But they also seem to think saying &quot;God All-sodding Mighty&quot; is blasphemous, which it isn&#39;t. <br />
Jesus&#39; name can be taken in vain, because people know what it is. God&#39;s name, however, is some variation on &quot;YWH,&quot; with some vowels shoved in. This is because the people who first wrote the name of God didn&#39;t want to put the vowels in, because they&#39;d catch Hell for it...<br />
It&#39;s probably Iehova. Or Jehova. Or Yaweh. But, frankly, shouting &quot;O Jehova-fiddly-piss!&quot; doesn&#39;t quite roll off the tongue.<br />
Trust an all-powerful deity to take all the simplicity out of sin, eh?
