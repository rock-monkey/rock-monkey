People have been asking me to do something about [[DanHuntley Dan&#x27;s]] [[HighScores HighScore]]  commenting on the fairness of the WikiBridgePuzzle, if people have a problem with this leave your name here. If more than 5 users sign up I&#x27;ll see what I can do. - RockMonkey

Reasons not to reduce [[DanHuntley Dan]]&#x27;s score:

~- It&#x27;s likely to be hideously difficult for a little RockMonkey
~- Almost all of [[DanHuntley Dan]]&#x27;s pages have &#x2F;&#x2F;actual content&#x2F;&#x2F;, unlike, for example, the whole HashBrowns&#x2F;HashBrownies pages (they&#x27;re not even funny - at least put a recipe in or something)
~- [[HighScores Score]] is a measure of quantity, not quality, of pages - unless you feel that quantity is so important (which perhaps some of you do, judging by the number of one-line pages popping up: doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m the one chasing a high score, really, does it?)
~- It&#x27;s a waste of time that could be better spent improving the Wiki
~- I&#x27;ve not done anything that the rest of you aren&#x27;t capable of - you&#x27;re, what, jealous of the amount of time I dedicated to adding content (about a three-to-four-hour stretch to get the basic WikiBridgePuzzle up and running, plus some debugging time)? Well hey; most of you have more free time than me! Perhaps we should have a PetitionToStopPeopleCaringSoMuchAboutPettyThingsAndGetOnWithLife

Wow, that was rantworthy. Hugz, y&#x27;all; [[DanHuntley Dan]]

Don&#x27;t sulk Dan; we all love you really. And I don&#x27;t think we could [[PetitionToTakeAwayDansInternetAccess take away your internet access]], anyway. - RuthVarley</script>
