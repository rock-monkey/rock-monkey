    After hearing both sides of the argument the <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> has decided not to reduce <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan&#39;s</a> <a href="/HighScore" class="internal">HighScore</a> since it was perfectly within his right and it should encourage everyone to create more pages in order to top his score.<br />
 Enjoy all - <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a><hr />People have been asking me to do something about <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan&#39;s</a> <a href="/HighScores" class="internal">HighScore</a>  commenting on the fairness of the <a href="/WikiBridgePuzzle" class="internal">WikiBridgePuzzle</a>, if people have a problem with this leave your name here. If more than 5 users sign up I&#39;ll see what I can do. - <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a><br />

<a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> (but only because <a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">Ruth</a> made him)<hr />Reasons not to reduce <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>&#39;s score:<br />
<ul><li> It&#39;s likely to be hideously difficult for a little <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a></li><li> Almost all of <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>&#39;s pages have <em>actual content</em>, unlike, for example, the whole <a href="/HashBrowns" class="internal">HashBrowns</a>/<a href="/HashBrownies" class="internal">HashBrownies</a> pages (they&#39;re not even funny - at least put a recipe in or something)</li><li> <a href="/HighScores" class="internal">Score</a> is a measure of quantity, not quality, of pages - unless you feel that quantity is so important (which perhaps some of you do, judging by the number of one-line pages popping up: doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m the one chasing a high score, really, does it?)</li><li> It&#39;s a waste of time that could be better spent improving the Wiki</li><li> I&#39;ve not done anything that the rest of you aren&#39;t capable of - you&#39;re, what, jealous of the amount of time I dedicated to adding content (about a three-to-four-hour stretch to get the basic <a href="/WikiBridgePuzzle" class="internal">WikiBridgePuzzle</a> up and running, plus some debugging time)? Well hey; most of you have more free time than me! Perhaps we should have a <a href="/PetitionToStopPeopleCaringSoMuchAboutPettyThingsAndGetOnWithLife" class="internal">PetitionToStopPeopleCaringSoMuchAboutPettyThingsAndGetOnWithLife</a></ul><br />
Wow, that was rantworthy. Hugz, y&#39;all; <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a><hr />Don&#39;t sulk Dan; we all love you really. And I don&#39;t think we could <a href="/PetitionToTakeAwayDansInternetAccess" class="internal">take away your internet access</a>, anyway. - <a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">RuthVarley</a>
