  <section>
    From now on this page shall at least be the starting point for all critism of Religions and <a href="/ReligiousArguments" class="internal">ReligiousArguments</a>. Using the name of a specific Religion as a heading to argue one point or another has been remarked upon to the management as being offensive and may lead to persercution. The offending pages will be cleared up by me, when I have the time, or by anyone else who can when they want to. It should be noted that the orginal pages wont be deleted just renamed in accordance with the princepals of fairness.<br />
- <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a><br />
And if anybody has anything to argue about that the <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> would find objectionable, they should argue about it on the <a href="/ArgumentsThatRockMonkeyDoesntApprove" class="internal">ArgumentsThatRockMonkeyDoesntApprove</a> page.<br />

Can we have a page that shall be the starting point for all &quot;critism&quot; of spelling?</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I agree that arguments shouldn't occur on the main page of the thing being argued about, but religious arguments is a really vague title. There should be separate pages for &quot;is the pope dead&quot; and &quot;Roman Catholicism: the way of the future&quot;. That might actually cause debate, not stifle it. (Not Alec, Claire)</div><cite><a href="/AlecR">AlecR</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I agree with Claire - the trouble with saying &quot;Religious Arguments&quot; is that, as briefs go, that's pretty damn vague. Does the Ontological Argument go here? Or are we looking at a page to examine the possibility that God was a creator who is now dead?<br />
<br />
And, on a similar theme - the other pages will be re-named on the prinicples of fairness as determined by whom? I doubt very much anyone's going to have a barney and start saying &quot;THAT'S not fair!&quot; but I wouldn't mind clarification all the same...</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote></div>
