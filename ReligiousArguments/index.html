Using the name of a specific Religion as a heading to argue one point or another has been remarked upon to the management as being offensive and may lead to persercution. The offending pages will be cleared up by me, when I have the time, or by anyone else who can when they want to. It should be noted that the orginal pages wont be deleted just renamed in accordance with the princepals of fairness.

And if anybody has anything to argue about that the RockMonkey would find objectionable, they should argue about it on the ArgumentsThatRockMonkeyDoesntApprove page.
