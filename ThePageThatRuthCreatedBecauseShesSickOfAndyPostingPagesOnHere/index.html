Also, it&#x27;s pretty shoddy that ThePageOnlyExtremelyCleverPeopleCanSee is blocked to all regular users. The implication that [[AndyKeohane Andy]] and [[DanHuntley Dan]] are the only intelligent people on this website is one that irritates me somewhat.

[[AndyKeohane Andy]] didn&#x27;t expect me to be able to see it, but I cleverly worked around it in a way that is equally manageable by (at least) [[MisterJTA JTA]], [[PaulMann Paul]], and you. - [[DanHuntley Dan]]

&#x2F;&#x2F;Except that I can&#x27;t use [[Linux]] and can&#x27;t use Putty and don&#x27;t know how to do any of that stuff&#x2F;&#x2F; - RuthVarley

Hmmm, RockMonkey was designed to be fun. The implication was not that I was anymore intelligent than other people on the site. The page was set up as a challenge, I wanted to see how long it would take for someone to get access to the page, the answer was not very long. The page was created for my own personal ammusement not as an insult. The implication that I would do otherwise hurts. AndyKeohane</script>
