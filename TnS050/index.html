You take a look at the stuff on the stall. At the back is a small bag which looks like it might contain money. In the middle are some assortments of the sort of rubbish you normally find in the back of cupboards that no-one&#x27;s been in for years. You can see a teapot with two spouts and no handle, an ornamental sugar bowl in the shape of an ornamental milk jug, some sort of corkscrew-like utensil with alarming red stains, and something which is obviously junk.

The laughter under the table is beginning to subside. You have time to steal one thing, if you&#x27;re quick.
