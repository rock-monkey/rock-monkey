Amiga (Spanish for &quot;Girlfriend&quot; - awwww) is a term used to describe a range of products marketed by Commodore (though not originally made by them) in the 80s and 90s

Practically invented the European DemoScene. Never terribly popular in the US

Almost bought by Atari, but Commodore got it instead.

(in very rough chronological order)

====A1000====
68000 at 7.14Mhz
Horrible. 256kb RAM. OperatingSystem came on floppy, which had to be booted before you could run anything, even self-booting applications. Kickstart 1.0

====A500====
68000 at 7.14Mhz
The first useable Amiga. 512k RAM. Kickstart 1.2. Has &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; inscribed on the motherboard because the developers were B52 fans. Immensely popular, and considered the &quot;base unit&quot; for about 6 years. Expansion slot known as the &quot;trapdoor&quot; due to it&#x27;s location

====A2000 A2500&#x2F;B2000====
68000 at 7.14Mhz, except for Unix A2000 with 68020 at 14.28Mhz
Business machines. Some came with a variation of Unix. Expansion slots known as &quot;Zorro&quot; slots. 2500 had 1Mb of RAM and Kickstart 1.3, others had 512kb and Kickstart 1.2. Came with built in hard drive

====A3000====
68020 at 14.28Mhz
The first seriously high-end Amiga. The Video Toaster (see later) was produced for this. Came with &quot;Zorro 2&quot; expansion slots. 6Mb of RAM. Wow. Hideously expensive (I believe the model number reflects the price). Also available in Unix flavour. Came with Kickstart 2.04. Also available in tower format. Built in hard drive. Introduction of ECS chipset

====CDTV====
68000 at 7.14Mhz
A mistake. Cost around five hundred pounds. Basically an A500 with no keyboard, mouse or floppy drive, a cheap CD-unit, and an AWFUL handset. Could still play Lemmings and Sim City though. Came with Kickstart 1.3 despite 2.04 already completed

====A1500====
68000 at 7.14Mhz
An A2000 with no hard drive and two floppy drives

====A500+ A600====
68000 at 7.14Mhz
A replacement for the A500 with 1Mb of RAM as standard, Kickstart 2.04 and ECS chipset. A600 produced later (Almost called A300, but they wanted it to sound like an upgrade - motherboard still says A300), and was almost identical except for the lack of a numeric keypad, and a PCMCIA slot instead of a trapdoor

====A4000&#x2F;040 A4000&#x2F;060====
68040 at 40Mhz, or 68060 at 60Mhz
The best equipped Amiga ever produced. Came with the brand new Kickstart 3.01. Available in a tower. 2Mb of RAM. &quot;Zorro 3&quot; expansion slots, on a par with PCI (Though horribly incompatible due to the Motorola&#x2F;Intel byte patterns being opposite). New AGA graphics chipset

====A1200====
68EC020 at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)
A home users version of the A4000. Slower CPU (14.14Mhz), but still came with 2Mb of RAM, which surprised a lot of people. PCMCIA slot.  Workbench 3.0

====CD32====
68EC020 at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)
To the A1200 what the CDTV was to the A500. A better start, and much cheaper. In fact, quite a few titles were ported to the platform. Could play VideoCds, IF you bought the FMV module (Ã‚Â£60 or so), due to the native CPU not being fast enough. Not compatible with most CDTV titles

====Custom Chips====
What made the Amiga the most powerful home computer were it&#x27;s custom chip sets. Individual chips to handle different tasks, taking the burden away from the CPU. Be fair, at the time, the Amiga was way ahead of the PC, just thanks to Commodore it was still in the same place 5 years later

Agnus &#x2F; Alice - the graphics chip. OCS (Original Chipset) and ECS (Enhanced Chipset) allowed up to 64 colours at 640x400. AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture, and the source of endless puns) allowed up to 256 colours at 640x400, and had a built in blitter

Paula - the sound chip. Could mix up to four channels of incoming data (including resampling if needed) and output as a stereo steam.  The tracker module originated on the Amiga due to the power of this chip

There are more, but they aren&#x27;t interesting. The CIA chips controlled the keyboard and disk drive, for example

====Titles====
Lemmings, Worms, Zool, 3D Construction Kit, AMOS (Later STOS for the Atari and KlikAndPlay for the PC), Alien Breed, Cadaver, Gods, Magic Pockets, Speedball, James Pond (and Robocod), Pinball Fantasies, Theme Park, Cybercon 3, Chips Challenge (Later part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack), Llamatron, Lotus I II and III, Prince of Persia, Beneath a Steel Sky, The Secret Of Monkey Island, Captive, Loom, Syndicate, The Chaos Engine, Chuck Rock, Shadow of the Beast, Xenon 2, Sim City and most popular AtariSt titles originated on the Amiga, and promptly suffered in the transition (1&#x2F;4 the number of colours and chip sound). Or worse, they were ported to the PC (In early cases, down to 4-16 colours, one channel sound)

In addition, serious titles like Deluxe Paint, POV-Ray, Lightwave (which led to the creation of 3D Studio Max as a competitor) and Cubase (almost certainly the origins of PropellorheadReason) had their origins on the Amiga

====Advancements and Plugins====
A501 and A520 were a hard drive and a memory expansion (not in that order) for the A500. Official CD drive produced for the A1200, but were beaten to the punch by Zappo, who produced one 6 months earlier for about Ã‚Â£100 less. Squirrel card allowed SCSI devices to be connected to the A1200, A600 and A4000. A few network cards produced, but most Amiga users connected via modem using AmiTCP

The likes of Power Computing produced lots of cool hardware for the Amiga, such as accelerator cards which could speed up your A1200 to up to 60Mhz with 20Mb of RAM. Nice. Or the Video Toaster which was used to produce a lot of video effects, including all the CGI for BabylonFive, and the videoscreen at the MiamiDolphins stadium in Florida. But people didn&#x27;t want to upgrade

Graphics cards became quite popular, with the likes of Picasso and Retina allowing 16-million colour in 800x600. A seriously nice piece of kit with practically no performance hit

====What Happened Next====
Commodore made hundreds of stupid decisions and it just became out-dated. The Amiga is still technically around (&quot;AmigaOne&quot;), but now it runs a form of BSD and uses Mac hardware, so you wonder how they can get away with calling it an Amiga

Emulation is still very popular, and we have only just managed to get PCs which can successfully emulate the Amiga&#x27;s custom chipset at any speed.

Games are still being produced, an example being &quot;Payback&quot;, at GTA clone. Not bad for 14.28Mhz, eh?

====Pointless Trivia====
The Amiga floppy drive had a seek time of 4ms, slightly slower than the Atari&#x27;s 3ms, but given they had at least twice as much memory, they didn&#x27;t spend as long accessing the disk :)

One of the first computers to have a built in GUI as standard

HAM-mode allowed up to (around) 262,400 colours to be displayed at once (still image only). This was done with some seriously messed-up maths which aren&#x27;t important to this Wiki. Plus, the sheer size of the files meant most of your memory was gone while you displayed the picture

The Amiga had two types of memory. Chip memory and Fast memory. Both were identical physically, but the physical memory was divided up upon boot-up. Chip memory could be accessed by any of the chips, and fast memory could only be accessed by the CPU. Simple. However, any memory added via expansion boards could only be fast memory. There was no way to increase the amount of chip memory. 2Mb was your lot. In addition, some early programs and demos _required_ fast memory. Luckily there were software programs to dynamically shift the boundary, providing you had the free RAM to do it

The 68000 range of CPUs only used the even numbers. 68010 was an aborted attempt at acceleration, and only 000,020,040 and 060 were used. Rumours about of an 030, but I&#x27;ve never seen one. I think there may have been an accelerator for the A1200 with one...
