MicrosoftNotePad is an ASCII text editor that comes packaged with MicrosoftWindows. It&#x27;s only notable &#x27;special&#x27; feature is an integrated search tool, which pretty much everything has anyway. It can handle only DOS-formatted [[UnixLineBreaks line breaks]].

It&#x27;s useful only if you happen to be using a Windows box and the phone rings and you need something close to hand to take notes in. That&#x27;s about it.

PaulMann would like to add it&#x27;s one of the few well designed applications which comes with MicrosoftWindows. It has a tiny memory footprint, and it loads incredibly fast.. I didn&#x27;t advocate it until the later versions where they removed the 64K file limit. Now my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t properly support linebreaks which lack the CR-byte (Windows uses CR&#x2F;LF, *nix and AmigaOS use LF only, MacOS uses CR only. From a purely technical point of view, you should probably be using just CR, since LF doesn&#x27;t have a physical-meaning unless you&#x27;re printing)</script>
