NegativeCampaigning, however, involves saying things like &quot;If you vote for &#x2F;&#x2F;them&#x2F;&#x2F; the world will end. And all your children will be [[QuadrupleFlyingBumrape QuadrupleFlyingBumraped]] by immigrants who will put you out of work. And the leader of the other party will become PrimeMinister and pimp your mum.

For some reason, NegativeCampaigning is becoming ever-more popular in the UK, probably because the Yanks like it too, and it requires far less effor than thinking of ways you could make the voters happy, and the country a better place.
