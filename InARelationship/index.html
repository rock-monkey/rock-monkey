You cannot randomly look at other girls&#x2F;men&#x2F;both (Delete whichever is inapropriate)

Your bed is fuller than it is when only you are in it.

Your monthly expenditure on CheapWhores drops dramatically.

Anyone who is not InARelationship complains about all the NoisyNookie you keep having.

You keep mentioning [[lesbians]] to your SignificantOther.

Your SignificantOther keeps beating you up every time DanHuntley opens his mouth.

----

When you are InARelationship, life is very happy and fun, and not even &#x2F;&#x2F;slightly&#x2F;&#x2F; scary, unless you are in an AbusiveRelationship, like the one MisterJTA is not in with RuthVarley.
