The Quay Cur leads the way through the ship, countless sailors wink and blow kisses to you as you descend into the hold. <br />
&quot;This must be the box here,&quot; says the Quay Cur and points at a small wooden box. You kneel down to examine it. There is a label on top which reads &quot;To Z from Captain Friedberger&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s in the box,&quot; says the Quay Cur &quot;and look it seems to have some kind of impossibly elaborate padlock on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d better not stay too long. We might get found.&quot;<br />
