The Quay Cur leads the way through the ship, countless sailors wink and blow kisses to you as you descend into the hold. 

&quot;This must be the box here,&quot; says the Quay Cur and points at a small wooden box. You kneel down to examine it. There is a label on top which reads &quot;To Z from Captain Friedberger&quot;.

{{InvPickup item=&quot;Vital Clue 1&quot;}}

&quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in the box,&quot; says the Quay Cur &quot;and look it seems to have some kind of impossibly elaborate padlock on it.&quot;

{{InvPickup item=&quot;Need A Key&quot;}}

&quot;We&#x27;d better not stay too long. We might get found.&quot;
