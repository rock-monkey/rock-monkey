      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">An alternative&#x2F;progressive rock band (or maybe not, depending on whether you mind definitions) formed around the songwriting abilities of one of the founding members, [[E]].

The band formed in 1996 or 1998 with Tommy playing Bass guitars, Butch on percussion and [[E]] on lead guitar, glockenspiel (which then becomes the rockenspiel) and wurlitzer. They all provided vocals and [[E]] was heavily involved in production of each of their records.

The band has gone through some personnel changes however [[E]] has remained constant and, much to the disamy of many [[eels]] fans, Butch has recently announced his departure from the group citing business, and not personal or creative, differences.

[[eels]] (no &#x27;The&#x27;) sidled onto the music scene in 1998 with their debut album BeautifulFreak. They did not burst, nor explode but slowly drew cult recognition in the US and more widespread following in Europe. BeautifulFreak was hailed for its haunting and touching lyric and excellent production and provided two of [[eels]] chart hits; &#x2F;&#x2F;Beautiful Freak&#x2F;&#x2F; and &#x2F;&#x2F;Novocaine For The Soul&#x2F;&#x2F;.

Fans were forced to wait two years for the next album due to the deaths of many of [[E]]&#x27;s family and friends. His mother suffered from, and eventually succumbed to cancer and his sister Elizabeth took her own life. The first track of the album ElectroshockBlues was titled &#x2F;&#x2F;Elizabeth On The Bathroom Floor&#x2F;&#x2F; and spoke directly of her suicide. The track &#x2F;&#x2F;The Medication Is Wearing Off&#x2F;&#x2F; was written as a response to &#x2F;&#x2F;Novocaine For The Soul&#x2F;&#x2F; to describe the loss of cynical detachment and the gain of pain. The album was described by [[E]] as the most up-beat he would ever produce because, whilst it dealt with the death of his family it also focused on his passage through the grief and the reasons to carry on living. Whilst the melodies and the majority of the lyrics of the ElectroshockBlues album are depressing the song will almost always end with an acceptance of life over death.

Having worked through many of his emotional problems [[E]] was able to make DaisiesOfTheGalaxy a pleasent and joyful album (comparatively) and much more of a crowd pleaser.

[[Souljacker]] was conceived, mainly, whilst [[E]] was ona spiritual retreat at which he was not allowed to speak or write. He became so creative during this time that he felt compelled to write what would become &#x2F;&#x2F;Souljacker Part 2&#x2F;&#x2F; on toilet roll and to hide it from the other members of the retreat. The album was co-produced by JohnParish and was another critical smash for [[eels]]. My particular favourite on the album is the track &#x2F;&#x2F;Fresh Feeling&#x2F;&#x2F;, a love song that re-uses a string quartet phrase that they used earlier in their career on the track &#x2F;&#x2F;Selective Memory&#x2F;&#x2F;. [[eels]] had used a similar trick before turning the instrumental for an early B-Side track Dog&#x27;s Life into the instrumental for their song EfilsGod. What [[eels]] had started other bands had used and reaped rewards for.

The following album [[Shootenanny]]! (a term coined by [[E]] to describe a [[Hootennany]] with guns) was far less autobiographical and featured a number of songs that could be considered as coming very close to jokes (&#x2F;&#x2F;Fashion Awards&#x2F;&#x2F; and &#x2F;&#x2F;Restraining Order Blues&#x2F;&#x2F;) and whilst there were a couple od songs that spoke of depression they were non-specific. This turn angered many of the &#x27;hardcore&#x27; fans who favoured the more emotional tracks that had been produced in the past. But no-one disputed that they still rocked.

A new album is due for release in 2005 and it is unsure whether Butch will be providing the percussion accompaniment but what you can be sure of (apart from cliches in summaries) is that it will be bought by their fans and that those determined few will try to enlighten the rest of the world to their greatness.


Best Album: [[Souljacker]]
