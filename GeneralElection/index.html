      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A traditional British mudslinging competition, held every four or five years, in which everyone votes for the party whose leader they like best, and whose policies they know least about.

Usually accompanied by sufficient NegativeCampaigning to ensure the slightly-clever-than-average-voters spend the entire campaign wondering why one party hates the other so much they&#x27;re more concered with smearing them than announcing any policies of their own.

The General Election for 2005 will be held on May the 5th.
