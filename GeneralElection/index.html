    <h2>GeneralElection</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    A traditional British mudslinging competition, held every four or five years, in which everyone votes for the party whose leader they like best, and whose policies they know least about.<br />
Usually accompanied by sufficient <a href="/NegativeCampaigning" class="internal">NegativeCampaigning</a> to ensure the slightly-clever-than-average-voters spend the entire campaign wondering why one party hates the other so much they&#39;re more concered with smearing them than announcing any policies of their own.<hr />The General Election for 2005 will be held on May the 5th.
