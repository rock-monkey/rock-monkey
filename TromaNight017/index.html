&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;I&#x27;m with the United Nations Dogs-For-The-Homeless Campaign. We&#x27;re the organisation that distributes cute-looking dogs to homeless people.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

**&quot;Like that one-legged one?&quot;**

&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;No; that one&#x27;s just had it&#x27;s leg eaten by a hungry beggar. But that&#x27;s just one of the advantages of giving dogs to the homeless: they also keep you warm at night, keep attackers away, and provide company. The fact that you can eat them if you get really hungry is a fringe benefit.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;
