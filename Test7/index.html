You&#x27;ve really screwed up this time. You&#x27;ve done something so bad, your other half may never forgive you. Something so disgustingly insensitive I can&#x27;t even bring myself to type it. How do you make it all better?

a) [[Test65 Pretend it was your long-lost twin who committed the terrible offence]]

b) [[Test64 Stick something in the nukerowave, dig out some candles and hope that food will win forgiveness.]]

c) [[Test63 Leave the country and never come back. Better that than being murdered as you sleep!]]

d) [[Test62 Buy everything in Thorntons, 100 tonnes of wrapping paper and a couple of crates of champagne.]]

e) [[Test61 Say your sorry. And mean it. If they can&#x27;t take the apology, then you&#x27;ll never win them back.]]</script>
