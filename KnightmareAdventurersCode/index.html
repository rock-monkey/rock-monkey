As used in [[Knightmare]], classic 80&#x27;s kids TV game show, and in the KnightmareWikiGame:

----
=== The Rules of the Knightmare Dungeon ===

1.  Your Life Force Status has three possible stages: GREEN, AMBER and RED. You begin the adventure on GREEN, indicating that you are unwounded and fresh for the Challenge.

2.  During your adventure you will gradually lose Life Force energy. You may also lose one Life Force grade all together if you make a mistake.

3. You can eat any item of food at any time which will restore your Life Force to GREEN. Your Life Force cannot go above GREEN.

4. You can carry up to two objects at a time. If you find an item which you want but you already have two, you must discard one. Objects from level 1 cannot be used in level 2 and so on.

5. You will sometimes be given spells to use during your adventure. You can only use up to three spells in your quest. Most spells are useful in several situations, but there will usually be one special situation that each spell is particularly helpful in dealing with. Choose the right moment to cast your spell, since a spell can only be used once.

6. Remain true to the Code of Chivalry: be courageous, dutiful and just, protect the weak, and show honour even in adversity.

One final point - the RIGHT-hand path is usually the best path to take, unless you are advised otherwise.
