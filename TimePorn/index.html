TimePorn is a category applied to various [[Television TV]] shows and other media which is enjoyable to watch because it depicts people who have so much more free time than you. So that while you watch you can fantasize about how great it would be to have so little to do.

An example is &quot;[[Friends]]&quot;, a SitCom in which several friends spend all thier time hanging around in a cafe, lounging in a flat, or otherwise wasting time. **Don&#x27;t these people have jobs???**

[[FortyFive 45]] by BillDrummond is RestlessBoy&#x27;s favourite example of TimePorn - even more satisfying because you know it&#x27;s non-fiction. The TimePorn equivalent of ReadersWives, except with readers who had really sexy wives. Wives who chopped up artworks and ate a piece of them.
