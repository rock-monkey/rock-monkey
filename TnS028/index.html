&quot;What queen? What are you talking about?&quot; You ask, totally confused.

&quot;You&#x27;re an outsider, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; The elf asks. You refrain from pointing out that the fact you&#x27;re a squirrel should have made this obvious.

He gestures at you wildly until you feel so disorientated you can&#x27;t bear to stand there any more.
