  <section>
    Series of 11 new records by <a href="/AphexTwin" class="internal">AphexTwin</a>. <br />
<a href="/Electronica" class="internal">Electronica</a>/<a href="/IDM" class="internal">IDM</a> made with analogue synths. Richard D James (his real name) used to build his own <a href="/Analogue" class="internal">analogue</a> <a href="/Synths" class="broken internal">synths</a>.<br />
The best <a href="/Analord" class="internal">Analord</a> release so far is Analord 10 (which was the first one to be released). Unfortunately it was released in a custom <a href="/Leather" class="broken internal">leather</a> binder designed to house the subsequent 9 Analord EPs and consequently costs Ã‚Â£45. Download it.<br />
Currently Analords 1-6 and 10 have been released. <br />
The first two are a bit dull, but from what I&#39;ve heard of the rest of them they&#39;re pretty good though they don&#39;t constitute a brain-melting step forward of the kind we&#39;re used to from RDJ. Though this still means they&#39;re several light years ahead of most contemporary electronica.<br />
REQUEST<br />
Whilst I have been buying them when I can afford to and intend to purchase them all, I have no means of putting them on my mp3 player other than by downloading them (and I&#39;m fucked if i&#39;m paying twice). So if anyone can help me find mp3s of Analords 3 and 4 I&#39;d appreciate it - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a><hr />Nothing at all to do with <a href="/Bumsex" class="internal">bumsex</a><hr /><a href="/CategorySongs" class="internal">CategorySongs</a>
