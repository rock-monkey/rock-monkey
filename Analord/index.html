      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Series of 11 new records by AphexTwin. 

[[Electronica]]&#x2F;[[IDM]] made with analogue synths. Richard D James (his real name) used to build his own [[Analogue analogue]] [[Synths synths]].

The best [[Analord]] release so far is Analord 10 (which was the first one to be released). Unfortunately it was released in a custom [[Leather leather]] binder designed to house the subsequent 9 Analord EPs and consequently costs Ã‚Â£45. Download it.

Currently Analords 1-6 and 10 have been released. 

The first two are a bit dull, but from what I&#x27;ve heard of the rest of them they&#x27;re pretty good though they don&#x27;t constitute a brain-melting step forward of the kind we&#x27;re used to from RDJ. Though this still means they&#x27;re several light years ahead of most contemporary electronica.

REQUEST
Whilst I have been buying them when I can afford to and intend to purchase them all, I have no means of putting them on my mp3 player other than by downloading them (and I&#x27;m fucked if i&#x27;m paying twice). So if anyone can help me find mp3s of Analords 3 and 4 I&#x27;d appreciate it - RestlessBoy
