**George**: I may look tough and mean-spirited but I&#x27;m really a sensitive artist.
**Girl**: That&#x27;s very interesting.
**George**: I paint, and I sculpt with my hands.
**Girl**: That&#x27;s very interesting too.
**George**: You have no idea what I&#x27;m saying, do you?
**Girl**: That&#x27;s very interesting.

Made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They of SouthPark fame. Excellent film. Watched far too often at TromaNight (Watched even more by AndyKeohane, because he loves it but can&#x27;t explain why.)
