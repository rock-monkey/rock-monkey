They make wordy countrified garage rock with added synth and weirdness.

Much beloved of RestlessBoy, there are a number of references to them in his [[WikiGames WikiGame]] TheRevengeOfZanatoth.

These include:
Quay Cur, Blueberry Boat, Chief Inspector Blancheflower, Birdie Brain, and Straight Street are all FF song titles. 

Obviously Captain Eleanor Friedberger and her dog Matthew are named after the band. Their album &#x27;Blueberry Boat&#x27; includes a song called &#x27;My dog was lost but now he&#x27;s found&#x27;, in which the lost mutt is &#x27;found&#x27; in religious terms in a church. As Matthew the dog is in TheRevengeOfZanatoth. 

In addition Ethan Appleday in TheRevengeOfZanatoth informs the player that they look &#x27;trouble trouble worried&#x27; which is a line from a song from the FF&#x27;s first album &#x27;Gallowsbird&#x27;s Bark&#x27;.
