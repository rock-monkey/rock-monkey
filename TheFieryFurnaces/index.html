They make wordy countrified garage rock with added synth and weirdness. <hr />Much beloved of <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>, there are a number of references to them in his <a href="/WikiGames" class="internal">WikiGame</a> <a href="/TheRevengeOfZanatoth" class="internal">TheRevengeOfZanatoth</a>.<br />
These include:<br />
Quay Cur, Blueberry Boat, Chief Inspector Blancheflower, Birdie Brain, and Straight Street are all FF song titles. <br />
Obviously Captain Eleanor Friedberger and her dog Matthew are named after the band. Their album &#39;Blueberry Boat&#39; includes a song called &#39;My dog was lost but now he&#39;s found&#39;, in which the lost mutt is &#39;found&#39; in religious terms in a church. As Matthew the dog is in <a href="/TheRevengeOfZanatoth" class="internal">TheRevengeOfZanatoth</a>. <br />
In addition Ethan Appleday in <a href="/TheRevengeOfZanatoth" class="internal">TheRevengeOfZanatoth</a> informs the player that they look &#39;trouble trouble worried&#39; which is a line from a song from the FF&#39;s first album &#39;Gallowsbird&#39;s Bark&#39;.<hr /><a href="/CategoryMusic" class="internal">CategoryMusic</a>
