    Er, where has this page gone?<br />
-- <a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonAtkinson</a><hr />It looks like it has been particularly thoroughly deleted. See <a href="/ArgumentsThatRockMonkeyDoesntApprove" class="internal">ArgumentsThatRockMonkeyDoesntApprove</a>.<br />

Do you realise how this is supposed to be read? Have you compared it to the Nestle page?</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">It was the note at the end that did not fit with the argument that I disliked. If it is an Anti Catholic Church then there should be no mention of Catholics but constant references to the Roman Catholic Church.<br />
