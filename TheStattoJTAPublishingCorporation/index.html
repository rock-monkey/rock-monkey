The first ever publication was &#x27;&#x27;The Statto and John Concise English Dictionary&#x27;&#x27;, whose name was soon shortened to &#x27;&#x27;The Statto Dictionary&#x27;&#x27;, which sought to describe small parts of the English language in an overly complex and cynical fashion. It was inspired by a certain Dr Ehlers, who, unable to think of any other achievements during the week at Arthog, awarded him the prize for &quot;only person to call a spade a primitive human-operated soil moving device.&quot; This was soon complicated further, resulting in &quot;primitive humanoid-operated soil particulate realignment device,&quot; and became the first definition in the first publication of the Corporation&#x27;s history.

Having been brought together by the circumstances of unfair groups, the pair set about writing ridiculous numbers of &#x27;&#x27;Dictionary&#x27;&#x27; entries, as well as starting a number of so-called &#x27;peripheral publications,&#x27; such as &#x27;&#x27;JTA&#x27;s Little Red Book&#x27;&#x27;, a collection of witty quotations, and &#x27;&#x27;Surviving Bus Journeys For Fun!&#x27;&#x27; a guide to use of public transport.

It was not until the founders were in Year 11, some three years after the creation of The Corporation, that their publishing became accessible to a wider audience. Having previously relied upon the Adams&#x27; Library printers, they branched out onto the [[Internet]]. Their first &#x27;Net-specific publication, &#x27;&#x27;The Curse of the Big Nasty Rabbit&#x27;&#x27;, was a point-and-click [[RPG r&amp;ocirc;le-playing adventure]].

Now, The Corporation has a vast behemoth of a website, over one thousand pages in size, with comprehensive archives of past publications. Their adventures continue...
