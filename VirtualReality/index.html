=== Summary ===

Reality, as existed in by ComputerScienceStudents (see also LaraCroft) and - alternately - by TheoreticalPhysicists.

=== But Seriously, Folks... ===

We were told by the popular media and films like LawnmowerMan that by the year 2000 VirtualReality would be the NextBigThing: whenever we wanted to be entertained we&#x27;d just slip on our [[VirtualReality VR]] goggles and experience something magical. This has turned out not to be the case, and despite several fields in which [[VirtualReality VR]] could be made to be useful, it is not used on account of being &#x27;retro&#x27;. It could be said that the VirtualReality revolution came and went in a negative period of time.</script>
