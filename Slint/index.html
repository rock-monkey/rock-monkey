[[Slint]] established its earliest roots when, in 1981, at the ages of
eleven and twelve, guitarist BrianMcMahan and drummer BrittWalford
began playing together in Louisville, Kentucky KY. In [[1984]], BrittWalford and
guitarist DavidPajo started collaborating musically at the ages of
fourteen and sixteen. 1985 saw the origination of Slint itself, the
band then comprising BrittWalford, DavidPajo, and bassist EthanBuckler. BrianMcMahan joined the following year.

In 1987, [[Slint]] recorded their debut album, &quot;Tweez&quot;, with SteveAlbini
behind the board in [[Chicago]] and released it on the short-lived and
enigmatic JenniferHartmanRecordsandTapes label. At this time,
EthanBuckler departed and was replaced on bass by ToddBrashear. 1989
saw the recording of their untitled EP, engineered by SteveAlbini,
mixed by BrianPaulson, and released by TouchandGoRecords.

In 1990, [[Slint]] recorded the landmark &quot;Spiderland&quot; album in Chicago
with BrianPaulson both engineering and mixing. This release, in
particular, became an IndependentMusic touchstone, loved and admired
by hundreds of thousands of fans and emulated by a generation of
musicians.

The following year, the year in which &quot;Spiderland&quot; was issued by [[TouchAndGoRecords TouchAndGo]], [[Slint]] broke up. For almost fourteen years, the members have not performed together as [[Slint]]. Now, for a very short time, they do so again.
