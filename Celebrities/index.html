[[Celebrities]] are also completely happy all the time. They are fundamentally better than you or I. They are more interesting, more attractive, more worthy of being saved in an earthquake, and more deserving of financial reward (as opposed to say a nurse, carer, teacher, doctor, fireman, policeman, parent...). 

The ultimate goal of any sane person&#x27;s life is to become a [[Celebrities Celebrity]]. If this cannot be achieved then we can get close to the experience by [[BuyThings buying things]] which [[Celebrities]] endorse. Or which are cheaper versions of things [[Celebrities]] endorse, which we find on the market for two quid. Because we cannot afford to [[BuyThings buy]] anything because all the wealth in the world is slowly filtering upwards to people who own [[Celebrities]]&#x2F;military suppliers&#x2F;oil companies&#x2F;IT companies&#x2F;AOLTimeWarner.
