    <a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">Celebrities</a> have the power to make everything in the world okay. Their mere presence at the bedside of a dying child means their passage through the horizon of pain into the cold arms of death will be transformed into a rollercoaster of photoshopped joy!<br />
<a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">Celebrities</a> are also completely happy all the time. They are fundamentally better than you or I. They are more interesting, more attractive, more worthy of being saved in an earthquake, and more deserving of financial reward (as opposed to say a nurse, carer, teacher, doctor, fireman, policeman, parent...). <br />
The ultimate goal of any sane person&#39;s life is to become a <a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">Celebrity</a>. If this cannot be achieved then we can get close to the experience by <a href="/BuyThings" class="internal">buying things</a> which <a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">Celebrities</a> endorse. Or which are cheaper versions of things <a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">Celebrities</a> endorse, which we find on the market for two quid.
