    <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> consists of twisted pairs of steel cable with sharp exposed points, designed to be used as fencing. It can be quickly errected by stapling lengths of <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> to fence posts, or dispensing rolls of it accross battlefields - such as was done in the <a href="/WorldWarI" class="broken internal">first</a> and <a href="/WorldWarII" class="internal">second</a> world wars.<br />
Approached carefully, <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> acts as a barrier to humans and animals. Approached recklessly, <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> can cause entrapment or severe injuries, particularly if the victim continues to struggle against it. Horses are particularly vulnerable to panicking and furthering injury in <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a>.<br />
When laying <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> in warfare, it is best not to try to completely block the passage of enemy infantry (which, in the end, is impossible) but simply to delay them and redirect them through the routes that can be best covered with machine gun fire.<br />
<a href="/RazorWire" class="internal">RazorWire</a> is a more vicious kind of <a href="/BarbedWire" class="internal">BarbedWire</a> designed to discourage humans, in particular, from climbing fences.<br />
Very useful. Compare and contrast <a href="/BarbWire" class="internal">BarbWire</a>, a useless film.
