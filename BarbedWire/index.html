BarbedWire consists of twisted pairs of steel cable with sharp exposed points, designed to be used as fencing. It can be quickly errected by stapling lengths of BarbedWire to fence posts, or dispensing rolls of it accross battlefields - such as was done in the [[WorldWarI first]] and [[WorldWarII second]] world wars.

Approached carefully, BarbedWire acts as a barrier to humans and animals. Approached recklessly, BarbedWire can cause entrapment or severe injuries, particularly if the victim continues to struggle against it. Horses are particularly vulnerable to panicking and furthering injury in BarbedWire.

When laying BarbedWire in warfare, it is best not to try to completely block the passage of enemy infantry (which, in the end, is impossible) but simply to delay them and redirect them through the routes that can be best covered with machine gun fire.

RazorWire is a more vicious kind of BarbedWire designed to discourage humans, in particular, from climbing fences.

Very useful. Compare and contrast BarbWire, a useless film.</script>
