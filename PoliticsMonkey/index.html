      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A PoliticsMonkey studies, unsurpisingly, politics. In Aberystwyth, this is usually of the International variety. 

There are generally two types of PoliticsMonkeys:

StratBoys: Take any module containing the magic words &#x27;nuclear strategy&#x27;, like to impress people in seminars with their vast and tiring knowledge of weapon specs and missile defence programs. Generally look down on...

Stroke-My-Dolphin Liberals: Take any module containing the words &#x27;Third World&#x27;, &#x27;famine&#x27;, or &#x27;Africa&#x27;. Naively believe they can change the world by studying such subjects. Can usually be found at an AmnestyInternational or LiberalDemocrat meeting. SianThomas could probably be considered one of these.

It has been rumoured that one out of twenty people living in Aberystwyth are PoliticsMonkeys.  </script>
