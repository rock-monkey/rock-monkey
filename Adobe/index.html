Bought Cool Edit, the best wave editor in the world, and rebranded it. And put the price up. And made a hash of it. Whoopee

Also made the latest versions of Premiere WindowsXP only, despite there being NO NEED to. The only reason you might want to do that would be because the graphics subsystems of Windows9x and WindowsNT&#x2F;2K&#x2F;XP are completetly different, but that&#x27;s not reason to alienate Windows2000 users, is it?</script>
