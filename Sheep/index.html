The plural of [[Sheep]] is [[Sheep]] this makes it impossible to know how many [[Sheep]] there are in any given location. Therefore counting [[Sheep]] helps people fall asleep as it a never-ending and highly tedious task.

[[Sheep]] were the inventors of [[Wool]] and wear it constantly.

Their favoured noise is &#x27;Baa!&#x27;.

Outside of [[Wales]] people often make jokes that [[Welsh]] people have [[Sex]] with [[Sheep]], this is not true though Shepherds around the world may sometimes use a [[Sheep]] to keep their [[Penis Penis}]] warm on a windy day.

Staunch anti-individualists, [[Sheep]] are forbidden from saying any word other than &#x27;Baa&#x27;. Young [[Sheep]] are therefore known as [[BaaLamb BaaLambs]].

The collective term for [[Sheep]] is as a [[Hive]].
