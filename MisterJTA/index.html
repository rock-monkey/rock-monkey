Sometimes she scares him. More often than that, though, she&#x27;ll hit him, because of something SomeOne has said. Or something DanHuntley has pretended he said, even when he didn&#x27;t. 

MisterJTA is an EnglishStudent or WordMonkey at the UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth and likes wearing waistcoats. He is a member of CAMRA, the CampaignForRealAle, having been weaned off cider by himself, and off Guinness by RuthVarley. 

MisterJTA was once the victim of an AssassinationAttempt, but managed to survive, after a bottle of ale effectively took the bullet for him.

He is only very slightly scared of his girlfriend, most of the time.

He plays a significant amount of NetHack, much to [[RuthVarley Ruth]]&#x27;s displeasure, and forms one half of TheStattoJTAPublishingCorporation.
