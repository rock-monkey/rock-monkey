Band formed by <a href="/KevinShields" class="internal">KevinShields</a> (who was more recently responsible for the <a href="/LostInTranslation" class="internal">LostInTranslation</a> soundtrack). They play indie rock buried under layers of bizarrely beautiful guitar effects. Haven&#39;t bothered making an album since 1991.<br />
Best album - Loveless.<hr /><a href="/CategoryBands" class="internal">CategoryBands</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Aloha!

Who the bloody Hell ARE these people?! Is RockMonkey falling prey to nutters who just grab the first link after a Google search &amp; assume that'll do them more good than reading the site before commenting on it? Or are they all taking the piss?<br />
<br />
Bryn, you've worked with lusers before: are people really so site-appearance blind that they'll assume it's relevant just because it turned up as a search result? PLEAAAASE say no...</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote></div>
