So, how did you get here? Well, that comes about in one of two ways.



If you got here through [[Chess005 A political thriller]] you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s quiet, with an exciting edge and a leaning towards a homicidal let&#x27;s-support-the-evil-guy streak .

On the other hand, you might&#x27;ve got here from  [[Chess007 reading a book for Adults Only]], in which case your choices peg you as quietly racy, with a self sufficient (and even self-centred) attitude towards life.

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
