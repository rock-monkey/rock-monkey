Alec is a man, he has more hairs on his head than most bears. He likes you. At time of writing he is high on coffee beans and using ClaireMelton&#x27;s PC having broken into her and DanHuntley&#x27;s flat. 

Alec is a TeachingMonkey, it&#x27;s his job to drag children kicking and screaming from the ways of [[ignorance]] and [[disnformation]] and into the light of understanding and tolerance. He used to be on the path to becoming a MoneyMonkey but recognised that there are many things more important, like pie.

Alec finds Wikis almost as addictive as UrbaneConversation, if you catch him at it past 12 you have his permission to call him a muppet and twang his braces (if he&#x27;s wearing any, which is frankly unlikely).
----

Recently Alec has started going round to exhibition galleries claiming to be an artist and offering to display work (which he has not yet done). He is a bit of a dreamer.

More recently Alec got engaged to SuzChilestone
