Alec is a man, he has more hairs on his head than most bears. He likes you. At time of writing he is high on coffee beans and using <a href="/ClaireMelton" class="internal">ClaireMelton</a>&#39;s PC having broken into her and <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>&#39;s flat. <br />
Alec is a <a href="/TeachingMonkey" class="internal">TeachingMonkey</a>, it&#39;s his job to drag children kicking and screaming from the ways of <a href="/Ignorance" class="auto-fixed internal">ignorance</a> and <a href="/Disnformation" class="auto-fixed internal">disnformation</a> and into the light of understanding and tolerance. He used to be on the path to becoming a <a href="/MoneyMonkey" class="internal">MoneyMonkey</a> but recognised that there are many things more important, like pie.<br />
Alec finds Wikis almost as addictive as <a href="/UrbaneConversation" class="internal">UrbaneConversation</a>, if you catch him at it past 12 you have his permission to call him a muppet and twang his braces (if he&#39;s wearing any, which is frankly unlikely).<hr />Recently Alec has started going round to exhibition galleries claiming to be an artist and offering to display work (which he has not yet done). He is a bit of a dreamer.<hr />More recently Alec got engaged to <a href="/SuzChilestone" class="internal">SuzChilestone</a><br />
<a href="/CategoryWikiPeople" class="internal">List of all wiki people</a><hr />Full stop mayhem.... <a href="/Fucktheshortage" class="auto-fixed internal">FuckTheShortage</a>
