This idea came about during the last few weekends. The theme will be &#x27;TromaNightAdventure&#x27;. The plan so far:

~-Figure out a list of all the places in TromaNightAdventure.
~-Figure out a route which takes in all of the above.
~-Figure out which pubs are on that route.
~-Go to all those pubs and drink.
~-Go to all the locations in the game, and take photos.
~-Upload the photos somewhere, and put them into the game.

Does anyone have any preference about when this should be? Who is coming?

~-JonAtkinson would come (because it was his idea). And I don&#x27;t really mind when.
~-DanHuntley is in (he&#x27;s behind TromaNightAdventure, so he&#x27;d love to be involved!)
~-AndyKeohane will be there (he is the RockMonkey after all). </script>
