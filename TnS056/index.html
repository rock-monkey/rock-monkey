The elf is still under the stall, although the laughter is subsiding. Before he can stand up and see you, you grab the corkscrew thingy and stick it into your utility belt, pulling your cape over it so he won&#x27;t see.

{{InvPickup item=&quot;Corkscrew Thingy&quot;}}

The elf appears from behind the stall, one hand on his back. &quot;Ouch, that stings!&quot; He exclaims.

&quot;I have some questions I&#x27;m hoping you can answer&quot;, you tell him.

&quot;In a moment.&quot; The elf says. &quot;First, give me back my de-wormer.&quot;

You look up when he says this. The foolish expression is gone from his wrinked face, and his eyes fix you with a scowl so severe you unintentionally step back.

What now?
