<ul><li> When you&#39;re in a bad mood, they don&#39;t try to cheer you up - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>.</li><li> They smell less awful - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>. (not true, my dad&#39;s <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cat</a> Harry farts like a human being after a big curry - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>)</li><li> In almost every case, they&#39;re more than capable of fending for themselves, should an emergency arise that requires them to.</li><li> They&#39;re so efficient they can get away with sleeping for two thirds of their life.</li><li> They come before <a href="/Dogs" class="internal">Dogs</a> in the alphabet.</li><li> They&#39;re not stupid enough to be whipped into pulling a sledge through snow.</li><li> Cats purr. </li><li> Cats rub your leg when they want affection, not when they&#39;re horny.</li><li> Cats use a litter box. Dogs use your leg.</li><li> Cats always land on their feet.</li><li> Cats look cute sleeping on the TV. Dogs just crash right in front of the screen.</li><li> Fewer cat owners suffer from &#39;Flappy Tail&#39; lacerations than dog owners.</li><li> No one has ever had to &quot;Beware of the Cat&quot;.</li><li> They&#39;re independent. If you forget to feed them they&#39;ll do fine.<hr /><strong>Reasons <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cats</a> are inferior</strong></ul><br />

<ul><li> You can&#39;t take them for walks (I used to take our cats for walks most days - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>:: I suspect your cats were exceptional. Did they start dancing round with excitement and miaowing with excitement when you told them they were going? - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RB</a>)</li><li> <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cats</a> will not show you affection unless it suits them, sometimes a <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cat</a> will be deeply loved by its owner and seemingly despise them in return. It&#39;s my theory that this means people who prefer <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cats</a> secretly hate themselves, believe themselves undeserving of love and therefore choose a pet that reflects this. (Of course any attempt to attribute feelings of &#39;love&#39; to a <a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cat</a> <em>or</em> <a href="/Dogs" class="internal">Dog</a> is an illusion you project onto their behaviour anyway. They don&#39;t love you, you just interpret their behaviour as meaning they do. Which only furthers my reasoning that people who choose cats hate themselves.) - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>.</li><li> They hang around with witches</li><li> People give them pretentious names like &#39;Desdemona&#39;, &#39;Mistopheles&#39;, and &#39;Chesterton&#39;.</li><li> When you&#39;re in a bad mood, they don&#39;t try to cheer you up - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a></li><li> They just wander off and get run over and die and you never find out what&#39;s happened to them</li><li> When <a href="/MrsSloakham" class="broken internal">a woman</a> strokes her <a href="/Cats" class="internal">cat</a> it can be a source of tedious innuendo</li><li> They&#39;re independent - they don&#39;t need you. You&#39;re just a convenient source of warmth and food.</li><li> They destroy furniture out of malice.</li><li> They leave heads (and tails) from <a href="/Mice" class="broken internal">Mice</a> in places where they aren&#39;t welcome, for example on your pillow.</li><li> When you stroke them and they don&#39;t want it, they arch their backs and hiss at you.</li><li> When they want stroking they headbutt your legs until you either give in or trip over.</li><li> They sit on your lap and dig their claws into your balls, for no reason.<hr /><strong>Reasons <a href="/Dogs" class="internal">Dogs</a> are superior</strong></ul><br />

<ul><li> They are funny (so are cats - <a href="http://www.cybersalt.org/cleanlaugh/cats/" class="broken external">see?</a> - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</li><li> You can teach them words</li><li> They will do tricks</li><li> They can defend you against burglars </li><li> They do that thing where they shake themselves clean when they&#39;ve had a bath (and this is a good thing? - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</li><li> They only smell if you let them smell</li><li> They can easily be trained to pee and poo in your garden - probably more easily than an average child human (like <a href="/Cats" class="internal">cats</a> then... - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a> :: you said &#39;<a href="/Cats" class="internal">Cats</a> use a litter box, dogs use your leg - <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> :: That&#39;s right - cats will use a litter box where a dog would use your leg; but cats can [very easily] be trained to go outside, instead... which means: cats are also suitable to be &#39;house pets&#39;: another point... - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</li><li> If they see a cyclist go past on TV they will try and watch it carry on riding past the side of the TV screen (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve explained this very well}</li><li> When you tell them it is time for food, they dance round excitedly and bark ecstatically rather than having an &#39;its about bloody time&#39; demeanour and mewing.</li><li> They &#39;love&#39; you unconditionally. Even if you treat them like shit. This is only a bad thing if you&#39;re a bad person. </li><li> They can help Blind and Deaf People</li><li> They can sniff out <a href="/Drugs" class="internal">Drugs</a></li><li> They can pull sleds</li><li> They can herd <a href="/Sheep" class="internal">Sheep</a></li><li> I once knew a <a href="/Dogs" class="internal">Dog</a> called Simon</li><li> <a href="http://b3ta.com/features/dogs-in-snoods/" class="broken external">Dogs in Snoods</a></li><li> If you have a big male dog you can wrestle it.<hr /><strong>Reasons <a href="/Dogs" class="internal">Dogs</a> are inferior</strong></ul><br />

<ul><li> Cats bury their crap. Dogs dig up others&#39;.</li><li> Cats don&#39;t love you unconditionally - they love you for what you do for them, rather than deceiving you because they&#39;re conditioned into seeing you as superior. - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> </li><li> They can maim you without warning</li><li> They stick their nose in your crotch.</li><li> They drool.</li><li> They destroy furniture because they&#39;re silly.<hr /><a href="/AnimalKingdom" class="internal">List of all pages about the AnimalKingdom</a></ul>
