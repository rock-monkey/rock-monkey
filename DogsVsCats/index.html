This is a page to discuss which is better [[Cats]] or [[Dogs]]

When you have considered the points, you can vote [[DogsVsCatsTheVote here]]

**Reasons [[Cats]] are superior**
{{image class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;A cat today&quot; url=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mycathatesyou.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;site&#x2F;britneydark2.jpg&quot;}}
~- When you&#x27;re in a bad mood, they don&#x27;t try to cheer you up - DanHuntley.
~- They smell less awful - DanHuntley. (not true, my dad&#x27;s [[Cats Cat]] Harry farts like a human being after a big curry - RestlessBoy)
~- In almost every case, they&#x27;re more than capable of fending for themselves, should an emergency arise that requires them to.
~- They&#x27;re so efficient they can get away with sleeping for two thirds of their life.
~- They come before [[Dogs]] in the alphabet.
~- They&#x27;re not stupid enough to be whipped into pulling a sledge through snow.
~- Cats purr. 
~- Cats rub your leg when they want affection, not when they&#x27;re horny.
~- Cats use a litter box. Dogs use your leg.
~- Cats always land on their feet.
~- Cats look cute sleeping on the TV. Dogs just crash right in front of the screen.
~- Fewer cat owners suffer from &#x27;Flappy Tail&#x27; lacerations than dog owners.
~- No one has ever had to &quot;Beware of the Cat&quot;.
~- They&#x27;re independent. If you forget to feed them they&#x27;ll do fine.

**Reasons [[Cats]] are inferior**
{{image class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Another cat today&quot; url=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jovan.ru&#x2F;pics2&#x2F;kittens&#x2F;ugly%20kitten.jpg&quot;}}
~- You can&#x27;t take them for walks (I used to take our cats for walks most days - [[DanHuntley Dan]]:: I suspect your cats were exceptional. Did they start dancing round with excitement and miaowing with excitement when you told them they were going? - [[RestlessBoy RB]])
~- [[Cats]] will not show you affection unless it suits them, sometimes a [[Cats Cat]] will be deeply loved by its owner and seemingly despise them in return. It&#x27;s my theory that this means people who prefer [[Cats]] secretly hate themselves, believe themselves undeserving of love and therefore choose a pet that reflects this. (Of course any attempt to attribute feelings of &#x27;love&#x27; to a [[Cats Cat]] &#x2F;&#x2F;or&#x2F;&#x2F; [[Dogs Dog]] is an illusion you project onto their behaviour anyway. They don&#x27;t love you, you just interpret their behaviour as meaning they do. Which only furthers my reasoning that people who choose cats hate themselves.) - RestlessBoy.
~- They hang around with witches
~- People give them pretentious names like &#x27;Desdemona&#x27;, &#x27;Mistopheles&#x27;, and &#x27;Chesterton&#x27;.
~- When you&#x27;re in a bad mood, they don&#x27;t try to cheer you up - RestlessBoy
~- They just wander off and get run over and die and you never find out what&#x27;s happened to them
~- When [[MrsSloakham a woman]] strokes her [[Cats cat]] it can be a source of tedious innuendo
~- They&#x27;re independent - they don&#x27;t need you. You&#x27;re just a convenient source of warmth and food.
~- They destroy furniture out of malice.
~- They leave heads (and tails) from [[Mice]] in places where they aren&#x27;t welcome, for example on your pillow.
~- When you stroke them and they don&#x27;t want it, they arch their backs and hiss at you.
~- When they want stroking they headbutt your legs until you either give in or trip over.
~- They sit on your lap and dig their claws into your balls, for no reason.

**Reasons [[Dogs]] are superior**
{{image class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;A dog today&quot; url=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;img34.photobucket.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;v104&#x2F;recon83&#x2F;stupid_dog.jpg&quot;}}
~- They are funny (so are cats - [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cybersalt.org&#x2F;cleanlaugh&#x2F;cats&#x2F; see?]] - [[DanHuntley Dan]])
~- You can teach them words
~- They will do tricks
~- They can defend you against burglars 
~- They do that thing where they shake themselves clean when they&#x27;ve had a bath (and this is a good thing? - [[DanHuntley Dan]])
~- They only smell if you let them smell
~- They can easily be trained to pee and poo in your garden - probably more easily than an average child human (like [[Cats cats]] then... - [[DanHuntley Dan]] :: you said &#x27;[[Cats]] use a litter box, dogs use your leg - RestlessBoy :: That&#x27;s right - cats will use a litter box where a dog would use your leg; but cats can [very easily] be trained to go outside, instead... which means: cats are also suitable to be &#x27;house pets&#x27;: another point... - [[DanHuntley Dan]])
~- If they see a cyclist go past on TV they will try and watch it carry on riding past the side of the TV screen (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve explained this very well}
~- When you tell them it is time for food, they dance round excitedly and bark ecstatically rather than having an &#x27;its about bloody time&#x27; demeanour and mewing.
~- They &#x27;love&#x27; you unconditionally. Even if you treat them like shit. This is only a bad thing if you&#x27;re a bad person. 
~- They can help Blind and Deaf People
~- They can sniff out [[Drugs]]
~- They can pull sleds
~- They can herd [[Sheep]]
~- I once knew a [[Dogs Dog]] called Simon
~- [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;b3ta.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;dogs-in-snoods&#x2F; Dogs in Snoods]]
~- If you have a big male dog you can wrestle it.

**Reasons [[Dogs]] are inferior**
{{image class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;A dog today&quot; title=&quot;Lick my stamp. You lick my stamp. It taste good. You like horse.&quot; url=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;b3ta.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;features&#x2F;dogs-in-snoods&#x2F;snood_b.jpg&quot;}}
~- Cats bury their crap. Dogs dig up others&#x27;.
~- Cats don&#x27;t love you unconditionally - they love you for what you do for them, rather than deceiving you because they&#x27;re conditioned into seeing you as superior. - DanHuntley 
~- They can maim you without warning
~- They stick their nose in your crotch.
~- They drool.
~- They destroy furniture because they&#x27;re silly.
