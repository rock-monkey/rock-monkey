Reviews from thread promoting [[ASSA]] on [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drownedinsound.com&#x2F;boards&#x2F;thread&#x2F;213332 Drowned in Sound]]

&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x27;Hey this is pretty fun really. It sounds like you were drunk&#x2F;tripping when you made it. Have you stolen the bass line from a Michael Jackson track?&#x27;&#x2F;&#x2F;

Reviews of ASSA from [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.b3ta.com&#x2F;board&#x2F;4474292 the b3ta messageboard]]:

&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x27;I don&#x27;t have anything wrong with &quot;your sound&quot;&#x27;

&#x27;for the first second or two I liked the synth. Then oh my what happened.&#x27;

&#x27;Fucking horrible. That is all&#x27;

&#x27;it&#x27;s Bollocks&#x27;

&#x27;Your music makes me want to have sex with each and every one of you several times, even though my feeble Prole mind can&#x27;t wrap itself around the truth it contains&#x27;

&#x27;Get to fuck And take that fucking nasty noise with you&#x27;

&#x27;don&#x27;t subject me to that pile of shit you are trying to pass off as music&#x27;

&#x27;Interesting very avant garde. reminds me of &quot;Dance Macabre&quot;&#x27;

&#x27;...it&#x27;s kinda the musical equivalent of forcing a sharp pencil up your own arse while vomiting dog shit out of your eyes.&#x27;</script>
