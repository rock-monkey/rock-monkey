</em>&#39;Hey this is pretty fun really. It sounds like you were drunk/tripping when you made it. Have you stolen the bass line from a Michael Jackson track?&#39;<em><hr />Reviews of ASSA from <a href="http://www.b3ta.com/board/4474292" class="broken external">the b3ta messageboard</a>:<br />
</em>&#39;I don&#39;t have anything wrong with &quot;your sound&quot;&#39;<br />
&#39;for the first second or two I liked the synth. Then oh my what happened.&#39;<br />
&#39;Fucking horrible. That is all&#39;<br />
&#39;it&#39;s Bollocks&#39;<br />
&#39;Your music makes me want to have sex with each and every one of you several times, even though my feeble Prole mind can&#39;t wrap itself around the truth it contains&#39;<br />
&#39;Get to fuck And take that fucking nasty noise with you&#39;<br />
&#39;don&#39;t subject me to that pile of shit you are trying to pass off as music&#39;<br />
&#39;Interesting very avant garde. reminds me of &quot;Dance Macabre&quot;&#39;<br />
&#39;...it&#39;s kinda the musical equivalent of forcing a sharp pencil up your own arse while vomiting dog shit out of your eyes.&#39;
