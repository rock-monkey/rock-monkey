This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of <a href="/BillDrummond" class="internal">BillDrummond</a> and <a href="/JimmyCauty" class="internal">JimmyCauty</a> using the moniker <a href="/TheKFoundation" class="internal">TheKFoundation</a><hr /><strong>1. The K-F Prize</strong><br />
The first thing anybody knew about <a href="/TheKFoundation" class="internal">TheKFoundation</a> was when a series of adverts started appearing in national newspapers, declaring such bizarre phrases as &quot;Kick out the clocks&quot; and &quot;K time&quot;, followed by &quot;Abandon All Art Now&quot;!<br />
Two weeks later, another advert appeared, announcing &quot;It has come to our attention that you did not abandon all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce the &#39;mutha of all awards&#39;, the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of the year&quot;<br />
And they did. Coincidentally their shortlist was identical to that of the Turner prize, and the same person won. The K-Foundation prize was double that of the Turner prize (Ã¯Â¿Â½40,000)<br />
The festival took place in a field, and the money was delivered in two bright orange armoured cars, with &quot;K Cera Cera&quot; and ABBA&#39;s &quot;Money Money Money&quot; blasting over the radio<br />
(See &quot;Nailed to a wall)<br />
They then returned to the arts gallery, and announced that Rachael Whiteread (the Turner prize winner) had won the prize and if she didn&#39;t collect it, it would be burnt. She didn&#39;t make an apperance until someone caught sight of <a href="/Gimpo" class="internal">Gimpo</a> fiddling with the lighter fluid and matches. The money was donated to needy artists<hr /><strong>2. Nailed to a wall</strong><br />
During the K-F Prize, A million pounds in Ã¯Â¿Â½50 notes was nailed to a large piece of wood and titled &quot;Nailed to a wall&quot;. It was then auctioned, with the starting price at half a million, on the grounds that inflation will erode it&#39;s value over time, but art is priceless.<br />
Since the money now had holes in it, the Bank of England wouldn&#39;t take it back, and fined Bill and Jimmy Ã¯Â¿Â½9000 for damaging money, and charged them Ã¯Â¿Â½500 to reprint it.<br />
Sources can&#39;t confirm this, but it may have given them ideas for their next stunt...<hr /><strong>3. &#39;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&#39;</strong><br />
They did. It was filmed by <a href="/Gimpo" class="internal">Gimpo</a>, and took place on the isle of Jura, Scotland. Yes, they really did it. There is video footage, witnesses, the bank confirmed it, and burnt Ã¯Â¿Â½50 notes kept appearing over the isle for the following few days.<br />
Bill and Jimmy brought back around Ã¯Â¿Â½80,000 of it (partially burnt) and paid a potter to bake them into a brick. Which he did. And then they filmed it. It&#39;s called &quot;The Brick&quot;. It&#39;s a 3-minute shot of a brick. So there you are. <br />
The film was taken around festivals and the like for a while, but interest was waning. Both for the audience and for the artists. So Bill and Jimmy signed a contract not to talk about the incident for 23 years. (on the bonnet of a car which they then pushed into the sea)<hr /><strong>4. K-Cera-Cera</strong><br />
&quot;Available nowhere ... no formats&quot; and not planned for release until world peace was established. At least, that&#39;s what the adverts said. But it did get a very limited release (3000) in Israel following the peace accord.<br />
Bill and Jimmy actually got the Red Army Choir to sing a version of &quot;Que Cera Cera&quot;, followed by &quot;War Is Over (If You Want It)&quot; (yes, *that* song). The end result is interesting, and certainly enjoyable<hr /><a href="/CategoryBands" class="internal">CategoryBands</a>
