This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the moniker TheKFoundation
---------------
**1. The K-F Prize**

The first thing anybody knew about TheKFoundation was when a series of adverts started appearing in national newspapers, declaring such bizarre phrases as &quot;Kick out the clocks&quot; and &quot;K time&quot;, followed by &quot;Abandon All Art Now&quot;!

Two weeks later, another advert appeared, announcing &quot;It has come to our attention that you did not abandon all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce the &#x27;mutha of all awards&#x27;, the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of the year&quot;

And they did. Coincidentally their shortlist was identical to that of the Turner prize, and the same person won. The K-Foundation prize was double that of the Turner prize (£40,000)

The festival took place in a field, and the money was delivered in two bright orange armoured cars, with &quot;K Cera Cera&quot; and ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Money Money Money&quot; blasting over the radio

(See &quot;Nailed to a wall)

They then returned to the arts gallery, and announced that Rachael Whiteread (the Turner prize winner) had won the prize and if she didn&#x27;t collect it, it would be burnt. She didn&#x27;t make an apperance until someone caught sight of [[Gimpo]] fiddling with the lighter fluid and matches. The money was donated to needy artists
----------------
**2. Nailed to a wall**

During the K-F Prize, A million pounds in £50 notes was nailed to a large piece of wood and titled &quot;Nailed to a wall&quot;. It was then auctioned, with the starting price at half a million, on the grounds that inflation will erode it&#x27;s value over time, but art is priceless.

Since the money now had holes in it, the Bank of England wouldn&#x27;t take it back, and fined Bill and Jimmy £9000 for damaging money, and charged them £500 to reprint it.

Sources can&#x27;t confirm this, but it may have given them ideas for their next stunt...
----------------
**3. &#x27;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&#x27;**

They did. It was filmed by [[Gimpo]], and took place on the isle of Jura, Scotland. Yes, they really did it. There is video footage, witnesses, the bank confirmed it, and burnt £50 notes kept appearing over the isle for the following few days.

Bill and Jimmy brought back around £80,000 of it (partially burnt) and paid a potter to bake them into a brick. Which he did. And then they filmed it. It&#x27;s called &quot;The Brick&quot;. It&#x27;s a 3-minute shot of a brick. So there you are. 

The film was taken around festivals and the like for a while, but interest was waning. Both for the audience and for the artists. So Bill and Jimmy signed a contract not to talk about the incident for 23 years. (on the bonnet of a car which they then pushed into the sea)

----------------
**4. K-Cera-Cera**

&quot;Available nowhere ... no formats&quot; and not planned for release until world peace was established. At least, that&#x27;s what the adverts said. But it did get a very limited release (3000) in Israel following the peace accord.

Bill and Jimmy actually got the Red Army Choir to sing a version of &quot;Que Cera Cera&quot;, followed by &quot;War Is Over (If You Want It)&quot; (yes, *that* song). The end result is interesting, and certainly enjoyable
