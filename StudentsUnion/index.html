The StudentsUnion, or less commonly, the &#x27;NUS&#x27;, describes itself as:

&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;...a voluntary membership organisation comprising a confederation of local student representative organisations in colleges and universities throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland which have chosen to affiliate and which pay a membership fee. We have nearly 750 constituent members (CMs)&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

In reality, (personal opinion alert) it&#x27;s a mis-managed drinking club, which has as little as possible to do with actual students. This way, they don&#x27;t have to spend too much money. Which means this money can be spent on the pet-projects of whichever trumped-up little politico that happens to be in charge at the time.

~-The main argument put forward for membership of the NUS is gaining &quot;national representation&quot; for students. It&#x27;s a nice idea, but in reality the NUS doesn&#x27;t faithfully or effectively represent the interests of its members. 
~-The NUS National Executive Committee is elected only by delegates to the NUS National Conference - who usually represent a political party or special interest group rather than the typical student.
~-For example, it was lobbying by the Aldwych Group - a campaigning group of independent student unions from 12 UK universities - that put an end to plans to charge &#x27;top-up&#x27; tuition fees. Scottish politicians scrapped tuition fees after a campaign by Scottish student unions - who aren&#x27;t NUS members. In both cases, the NUS tried to take the credit.
~-Students are best represented by people whose sole objective is to promote the interests of the student body, not by those who wish to use the NUS as a springboard to a lifetime in politics. 

==Beer and Food==

~-The NUS doesn&#x27;t deal with the Carlsberg-Tetley Group, which means no Carlsberg Export. 
~-Indeed, it only deals with it&#x27;s favoured bulk-purchasers - which means no RealAle for BeerSnobs. 
~-The same goes for chocolate - the NUS has fallen out with [[Nestle]], so they want us to ban all Nestle products - [[KitKat Kit-Kats]], for fucks sake. This is hardly a good use of a sabbatical&#x27;s time, is it?

Is this ridiculously false political machine really worth the Ã‚Â£35,000&#x2F;year membership fee?

It should be said that the NUS and the StudentsUnion are two linked, but different things. The StudentsUnion can also refer to the building on the PenglaisCampus of [[UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth UWA]] that houses the Union offices, the Union shop, [[9Bar9]] and TheJoint.
