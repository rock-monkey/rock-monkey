Sadly departed singer-songwriter who went completely unrecognised in his lifetime selling only 5,000 records before overdosing on sleeping tablets in 1976, it is not sure whether his death was suicide or a tragic accident. 

Released three albums &#x27;Five Leaves Left&#x27;, &#x27;Bryter Layter&#x27;, and &#x27;Pink Moon&#x27; and has had unreleased material compiled on &#x27;Time of no reply&#x27; and &#x27;Made to love magic&#x27;. His subtle guitar playing is amongst the most complicated ever recorded and his voice and lyrics betray youthful melancholy like few before or since.

best album: five leaves left.
