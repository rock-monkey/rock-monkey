Sadly departed singer-songwriter who went completely unrecognised in his lifetime selling only 5,000 records before overdosing on sleeping tablets in 1976, it is not sure whether his death was suicide or a tragic accident. <br />
Released three albums &#39;Five Leaves Left&#39;, &#39;Bryter Layter&#39;, and &#39;Pink Moon&#39; and has had unreleased material compiled on &#39;Time of no reply&#39; and &#39;Made to love magic&#39;. His subtle guitar playing is amongst the most complicated ever recorded and his voice and lyrics betray youthful melancholy like few before or since.<br />
best album: five leaves left.<hr /><a href="/CategoryMusic" class="internal">other pages about music</a>
