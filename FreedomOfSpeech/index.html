  <section>
    Unfortuately no speach will ever be free. It will always be at at least one person&#39;s expence, we all just have to try and put what we think in the most balanced way possible and not use counter arguments such as &quot;but you&#39;re wrong because I say so&quot;.<hr /><a href="/ClaireMelton" class="internal">Claire</a> - Whether speech hurts someone or not has nothing to do with whether it is free or not. You mean &quot;No speech will ever be universally accepted or agreed with&quot;. Free speech is about being allowed to say anything, offensive, contraversial, just plain silly, or whatever, and also that others have the right to challenge what you say, because free speech is(or should be) universal. It is the complete absence of censorship.<br />
<a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a> - I agree. <a href="/FreedomOfSpeech" class="internal">FreedomOfSpeech</a> is nothing to with people&#39;s opinions of each other&#39;s ideas, it&#39;s about the right to express those ideas. Sadly, we&#39;re yet to see it truly embraced.<br />
