[[ClaireMelton Claire]] - Whether speech hurts someone or not has nothing to do with whether it is free or not. You mean &quot;No speech will ever be universally accepted or agreed with&quot;. Free speech is about being allowed to say anything, offensive, contraversial, just plain silly, or whatever, and also that others have the right to challenge what you say, because free speech is(or should be) universal. It is the complete absence of censorship.

[[DanHuntley Dan]] - I agree. FreedomOfSpeech is nothing to with people&#x27;s opinions of each other&#x27;s ideas, it&#x27;s about the right to express those ideas. Sadly, we&#x27;re yet to see it truly embraced.
