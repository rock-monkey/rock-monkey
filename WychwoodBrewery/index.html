      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">WychwoodBrewery make HobGoblin, CircleMaster, FiddlersElbow and [[Goliath]], all of which are very nice types of RealAle. People in AberWorld can have difficulty getting HobGoblin, but FiddlersElbow is very popular in TheFlat come TromaNight.

MisterJTA once looked all over their website - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wychwood.co.uk&#x2F; - in the hope that he could find one of their &#x27;Largerboy&#x27; posters in the shop (which shows the legendary HobGoblin clutching a pint of the eponymous brew and demanding &quot;What&#x27;s the matter, LagerBoy, afraid you might taste something?&quot;) and couldn&#x27;t find one.

As a result, MisterJTA e-mailed the lovely people of the WychwoodBrewery, and they sent him two HobGoblin posters for free.

So go buy their beer!</script>
