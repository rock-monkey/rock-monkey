I took over this page to try and push my HighScores up. I don&#x27;t actually agree with it- surely winning on penalties **does** make you better, at least at taking penalties? Plus, if it got to that stage they must have been at least equal for the 90 mins beforehand (maybe with extra time too, I didn&#x27;t watch it.).

So to conclude- shush, you bitter Man U fan you.
