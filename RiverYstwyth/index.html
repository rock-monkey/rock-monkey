    It&#39;s a river near <a href="/AberystwythTown" class="internal">AberystwythTown</a>, but I&#39;m sure some <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> can add more here.<hr />See also <a href="http://www.guidebook.free-online.co.uk/ystwyth.htm" class="broken external">http://www.guidebook.free-online.co.uk/ystwyth.htm</a><br />
<a href="/CategoryAberPlaces" class="internal">Places in Aberystwyth</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">It's not so much that the town should be called Aberrheidol, really; more that the town's moved further away from the Ystwyth over time (although I think that the Ystwyth now feeds into the Rheidol above the Marina somewhere, yes?)Back when the town was a little hill fort on Pen Dinas it probably made more sense, but the castle moved things round a bit, and so on... The Ystwyth is in Aber, it's just not taking up half of Great Darkgate street, which is probably A Good Thing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point is, changing the name to Aberrhiedol is a bad idea, because it sounds yuck, and nobody really cares which river it is anyway (it's not like the whole town relies on fishing, anymore...)</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">No, the Rheiddol is the one that feeds into the marina. The Ystwyth is on the *other side* of Pen Dinas.</div><cite><a href="/217.140.43.3">217.140.43.3</a></cite></blockquote></div>
