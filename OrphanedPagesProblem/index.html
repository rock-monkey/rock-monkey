  <section>
    <h3>The <a href="/OrphanedPagesProblem" class="internal">OrphanedPagesProblem</a></h3>The <a href="/OrphanedPagesProblem" class="internal">OrphanedPagesProblem</a> was identified in the <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> <a href="/ChatRoom" class="internal">ChatRoom</a> by <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a> on the 18th May 2005. <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a> are <a href="/WikiPages" class="broken internal">WikiPages</a> which are not linked to by any other page on the wiki. Some extend this definition to include orphaned clusters: selections of pages which are not linked to from anywhere else in the <a href="/BigCloud" class="internal">BigCloud</a>, but link to one another. Parts of the debate follow. Please feel free to chirp in with suggestions:<hr /><strong><a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a> suggests a way to prevent <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a></strong><br />
I have a suggestion for <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a>, which I&#39;ll leave here for people to peruse in the morning, or whenever. *cough*. Make it so whenever the &quot;edit&quot; script is accessed, the referrer is checked, and the edit page only appears correctly if it was accessed by clicking on a <a href="/WikiWord" class="internal">WikiWord</a>, rather than typing theaddress in manually. That should greatly remove the number of <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a> which seem to be appearing at a rapid rate, largely thanks to <a href="/MilfordCubicle" class="internal">MilfordCubicle</a>.<hr /><strong><a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> picks holes in <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a>&#39;s argument, and suggests a bad alternative</strong><br />
Nice idea, but won&#39;t work with browsers that hide referrers (many installs of <a href="/ZoneAlarm" class="broken internal">ZoneAlarm</a> do this when jumping trans-site, so people only see &quot;local&quot; referrals), and, more importantly, won&#39;t work if user came directly to page (which is common for me, because I find out about <a href="/RecentChanges" class="internal">RecentChanges</a> by <a href="/RSS" class="broken internal">RSS</a> andjust &quot;jump in&quot;, and sometimes by <a href="/WikiGame" class="broken internal">WikiGame</a> developers).<br />
In addition, <a href="/WikiGames" class="internal">WikiGames</a> may suffer, as it&#39;s very difficult or impossible to write code that will detect, for example, wiki links which only appear as a result of tokens or are full (http://...) links, so if you used one of these you&#39;d likely be denied from changing the resulting page.<br />
But you&#39;re right about the <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a> situation, <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">Paul</a>. Perhaps there&#39;s another way...<br />
We could make it, for example, such that: &quot;If you own more orphaned pages than anybody else, and this is more than X (3?), you may not edit pages other than orphaned pages&quot;. This will result in people having to reduce the number of orphans they&#39;re responsible for before they can do other edits, and by doing so, they become second-worst for it, making somebody else the <a href="/OrphanMaster" class="broken internal">OrphanMaster</a>, until all active members have less than X <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a>.<br />
However, again, there&#39;s a problem as far as the linking structure is concerned. A page which only contains a link to a category page appears orphaned, but is not, and a page linked to only by <a href="/WikiGame" class="broken internal">WikiGame</a> code (e.g.some of <a href="/TromaNightAdventure" class="internal">TromaNightAdventure</a>/<a href="/RestlessWorld" class="internal">RestlessWorld</a>&#39;s dead scenes) appear orphaned, but are not under the correct (tokens/items) circumstances.<br />
Plus, an almost equally-big problem to orphaning is seperation from &quot;The <a href="/BigCloud" class="internal">BigCloud</a>&quot;, small clusters - usually of just two <a href="/WikiPage" class="auto-fixed internal">WikiPages</a> - of pages that are connected to one another but to nothing else.<br />
While not technically orphans, they contribute equally little to wiki structure.<br />
Suggestions welcome.<hr /><strong><a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">RuthVarley</a> pitches in despite being only a junior grade geek</strong><br />
Well, it would probably help if everybody just read this page, felt guilty, and went away to fix orphaned pages they knew they&#39;d created in the past...<hr /><strong><a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> backs up <a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">Ruth</a></strong><br />
I&#39;d love to see things work based on community-lovey-ness and respect for one another and for the wiki. But that&#39;s not likely to happen, is it. I&#39;m never a fan of saying this, but a technical solution may actually be the best answer.<br />
Perhaps we could make it impossible to make a page unless a link exists to it already? But we&#39;d still have the wikigame/category problems, potentially.<hr /><strong><a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> adds his two cents</strong><br />
Maybe we could just acknowledge that the whole of <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> is just something a very small number of people use for pissing around having fun when they&#39;re bored and that it doesn&#39;t really matter if some pages get lost on the way, or if <a href="/Watermelon" class="internal">Watermelon</a> links to <a href="/Kangaroo" class="internal">Kangaroo</a>. It&#39;s not like anyone really uses this as a serious info resource. The <a href="/WikiGames" class="internal">WikiGames</a> are the biggest chunk of it volume-wise and most of the rest is just for people to take the piss (see <a href="/Daventry" class="internal">Daventry</a>).<hr /><strong><a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> sits on the fence a little longer</strong><br />
Aye, I agree with <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>. The <a href="/OrphanedPages" class="internal">OrphanedPages</a> problem is not such a problem as one might expect, compared to the <a href="/BadPagesNoLinks" class="internal">dead-end pages</a> and the (awful) <a href="/BadPagesNoContent" class="internal">content-less pages</a>.<br />
<a href="/Watermelon" class="internal">Watermelon</a> and <a href="/Kangaroo" class="internal">Kangaroo</a> are part of the <a href="/BigCloud" class="internal">BigCloud</a>. =o)<hr /><strong><a href="/JimmyCarter" class="internal">JimmyCarter</a> adds a little aside</strong><br />
Would it be possible to represent the big cloud/ little clouds in some sort of diagram, showing how many pages are in each and the connections between them? I&#39;m thinking of those <a href="http://research.lumeta.com/ches/map/gallery/index.html" class="broken external">Internet Mapping</a> guys here, but obviously on a much smaller scale.<br />
It <em>might</em> help to track and shut down the errant clusters (doesn&#39;t that sound slightly Blade Runner-ish?), but it will look nice and pretty.<hr /><strong><a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> answers</strong><br />
Yes, it&#39;s possible.<br />
Yes, I&#39;d love it to happen.<br />
No, I don&#39;t have the time or inclination to write the program. But I&#39;ll lend all the support I can to anybody who does. Perhaps some young geek might like to have a stab at the project over the summer. Just tell me if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll tell you what it&#39;ll entail.<hr /><strong><a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">RuthVarley</a> gets all enthusiastic</strong><br />
Ooh, ooh, I want to do it!<br />
um... how?<hr /><em>Your Suggestion Here</em><hr />See also <a href="/WhyOrphanedPagesAreAProblem" class="internal">WhyOrphanedPagesAreAProblem</a><hr /><a href="/CategoryWiki" class="internal">CategoryWiki</a>
