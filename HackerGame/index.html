    <img src="" alt="" class="left" /><a href="/HackerGame" class="internal">Hacker</a> is a custom card game by <a href="/SteveJacksonGames" class="internal">SteveJacksonGames</a>. It features a particularly complicated ruleset, and some horrendous in-game mathematics (have a <a href="/MathMonkey" class="internal">MathMonkey</a> around whenever you&#39;re playing it!), but it&#39;s still a great game. In the game, players (hackers) have to try to gain access to as many systems as possible - systems are represented by cards, each with potential connections on their &#39;edges&#39; to other nearby systems. Co-operation is encouraged to a high degree (<em>&quot;I&#39;ll give you the information you need to hack into <a href="/ThePentagon" class="internal">ThePentagon</a> if you give me your Hackintosh!&quot;</em>), but backstabbing is common.<br />
<a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a> thinks that the game would make a fantastic multiplayer computer game, and keeps promising to have a go at making it. However, as he&#39;s always promising such things, he&#39;s got far too many projects on the go to finish any given one of them.<br />
