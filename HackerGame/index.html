It features a particularly complicated ruleset, and some horrendous in-game mathematics (have a MathMonkey around whenever you&#x27;re playing it!), but it&#x27;s still a great game. In the game, players (hackers) have to try to gain access to as many systems as possible - systems are represented by cards, each with potential connections on their &#x27;edges&#x27; to other nearby systems. Co-operation is encouraged to a high degree (&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;I&#x27;ll give you the information you need to hack into ThePentagon if you give me your Hackintosh!&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;), but backstabbing is common.

DanHuntley thinks that the game would make a fantastic multiplayer computer game, and keeps promising to have a go at making it. However, as he&#x27;s always promising such things, he&#x27;s got far too many projects on the go to finish any given one of them.
