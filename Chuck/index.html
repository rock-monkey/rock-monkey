[[www.teagames.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;chuck&#x2F;play.php Chuck]] is a fantastic game from the creators of [[www.teagames.com teagames.com]] in which you throw&#x2F;launch a crash dummy through four different stages, each one as strenuous as the next.  To get a [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teagames.com&#x2F;index.php?page=scores_best_chuck_0_0 high score]], you must be able to throw the man the furthest and the most accurately depending on which stage youre on.  

You will have trouble beating my record though, as it is currently the highest score I&#x27;ve personally seen so far.  However, they regularly refresh the score boards and remove high scores, but I managed to take a screen shot of the wonderful result...
