      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A situation where some people find a virgin wiki and try to race through all the good topics and get the first word in on them.

Past WikiRace history:

== DanHuntley, AndyKeohane, JonAtkinson - on the 28th of October, 2004 ==

Breaking News 1: AndyKeohane seems to have dropped out of the race.
Breaking News 2: AndyKeohane is back in the race!!
Breaking News 3: DanHuntley seems to have dropped out of the race.
Breaking News 4: No, DanHuntley merely had to go and talk to LyndaRollason about the StudentSkillsCompetition 2005. He&#x27;ll be helping out [[Backstage]] and with TechnicalSupport.

== AndyKeohane and RuthVarley - on the 29th of October, 2004 ==

== DanHuntley - on the 2nd of November, 2004 ==

[[DanHuntley Dan]] takes [[HighScores a huge lead]] when he makes WikiBridgePuzzle!

&#x2F;&#x2F;Some might call this cheating...&#x2F;&#x2F; - RuthVarley

&#x2F;&#x2F;I&#x27;d say this is certainly cheating because Dan wrote a script to create the pages. I DEMAND A RECOUNT!&#x2F;&#x2F; - JonAtkinson

&#x2F;&#x2F;Ah; I made 60 or so of them by hand, and I had to manually copy-paste things into and out of the script, so I think it counts.&#x2F;&#x2F; - DanHuntley
