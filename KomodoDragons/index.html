Aka &quot;Bearded Dragon&quot;. Not to be confused with a <a href="/Dragon" class="internal">Dragon</a><br />
Grows up to 3 metres in length, weighs between 80 and 140kg. Considered the &quot;most intelligent living reptiles&quot;<br />
//They are carnivores and hunt live prey, with a stealthy approach followed by a sudden short charge (they can run briefly at speeds up to 20 km/h). They have a strong bite augmented by severe infection of wounds, caused by the some 50 different strains of bacteria in their saliva. After they bite, they release their prey to allow it to die before devouring it; this allows them to avoid injury. Dragons will fight over kills, however unlike any other known animal, they are themselves immune to bacterial infection from dragon bites.<br />

Dragons eat any animals they can catch, up to the size of wild pigs, goats, deer, and water buffaloes and occasionally including human beings. Over a dozen human deaths have been attributed to dragon bites in the last century, though there are reports of survivors of the resulting septicemia.// - <a href="/Wikipedia" class="internal">Wikipedia</a><br />
Only around 6000 left, mostly in Indonesia and the island of Komodo.<hr /><a href="/AnimalKingdom" class="internal">List of all members of the AnimalKingdom</a>
