    The UN is a multi-national intergovernmental organisation dealing with thousands of issues which affect a multitude of people around the globe.  From health to education to simply food and water the UN is an important player on the global stage specifically related to humanitarian issues.<br />
It has however come under lots of pressure of late due to the foreign policies of some states and internal scandals.<br />
Is famous for messing up in Rwanda and sending in a small group of Dutch soldiers with small arms against a mass of people with tanks, mortars and other such weapons to protect part of the population in the break up of Yugoslavia.<br />
Is also famous for inspiring humanitarian intervention, the world food programme, the millennium development goals and keeping the peace in various parts of the planet.<br />
Like everything t&#39;is good and is bad.<br />
