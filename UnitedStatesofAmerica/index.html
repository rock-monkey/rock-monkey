    Ignore it and maybe it will go away.<br />
A land so free that even a chimpanzee may become its leader provided it was a natural born citizen. <br />
And rich...<br />
And white..<br />
And conservative...<br />
And anti-abortion/homosexuality/anything non-christian...<br />
And male (so in a way a <a href="/Lesbian" class="internal">Lesbian</a> with a penis. Sort of.)...<br />

Also, only 50% of them are too facist/don&#39;t know any better, 50% voted democrat, (some of them were anusses too, so it doesn&#39;t proove much) <a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a><br />
