    <a href="/PlaidCymru" class="internal">PlaidCymru</a> - The Party of Wales<br />
They are the Welsh Nationalist party.  They stand for an independant Wales within the European Union, social justice, economic prosperity and care for the natural environment.<br />
They also protect and promote the Welsh language, as well as attempt to increase Wales&#39; profile on the international stage with a view to becoming an independent member of the <a href="/UnitedNations" class="internal">UnitedNations</a> .<br />
They currently have 3 MPs, 12 National Assembly Members and 1 MEP, all working for Wales.  Along with the SNP they are part fo the European Free Alliance Group in the <a href="/EuropeanParliament" class="internal">EuropeanParliament</a>.<br />
<a href="/MattPayne" class="internal">MattPayne</a> worked as a parliamentary researcher for them for a while in the summer and enjoyed wandering around parliament in combats and a bright yellow T-shirt.  The MPs are lovely and Simon Thomas the (former) MP for Ceredigion is a really nice up-right bloke, who cares about his (ex) job.  The others are also really friendly and particulary Adam Price MP for Camarthan East, are a good laugh.<br />
