They are the Welsh Nationalist party.  They stand for an independant Wales within the European Union, social justice, economic prosperity and care for the natural environment.

They also protect and promote the Welsh language, as well as attempt to increase Wales&#x27; profile on the international stage with a view to becoming an independent member of the UnitedNations .

They currently have 3 MPs, 12 National Assembly Members and 1 MEP, all working for Wales.  Along with the SNP they are part fo the European Free Alliance Group in the EuropeanParliament.

MattPayne worked as a parliamentary researcher for them for a while in the summer and enjoyed wandering around parliament in combats and a bright yellow T-shirt.  The MPs are lovely and Simon Thomas the (former) MP for Ceredigion is a really nice up-right bloke, who cares about his (ex) job.  The others are also really friendly and particulary Adam Price MP for Camarthan East, are a good laugh.
