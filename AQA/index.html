Questions asked include;

DanHuntley: How cool is RockMonkey?
[[AQA]]: RockMonkey.org.uk is very very cool indeed as the Wiki-powered site is run by [[AberystwythTown Aberystwyth]]Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s number one dude &amp;amp;amp;amp; mountain-lover [[AndyKeohane Andy Keohane]].

MisterJta: Why is it inadvisible to have intimate physical relations with a geode?
[[AQA]]: A geode is a rock cavity, usually lined with crystals. [[AQA]] predicts that sex with a geode would be painful, unsatisfying, but shiny.

DanHuntley: Is Santa Claus real?
[[AQA]]: Providing you believe in [[SantaClaus Santa Claus]], then he will remain real. He is part of the traditional Christmas and also goes by the alias of [[SantaClaus Santa Claus]].
&#x2F;&#x2F;His alias is the same as his name. Wow.&#x2F;&#x2F;

DanHuntley: Is &#x27;no&#x27; the answer to this question?
[[AQA]]: The question requires an answer that implies its own negation and is therefore a logically unsound proposition. It&#x27;s impossible to be smarter than [[AQA]].

DanHuntley: If you read this you are gay.
[[AQA]]: Darn, you got [[AQA]]. Fortunately, if you have carried on reading this, then you are gay as well. Also, if you read this, you smell.

MisterJTA: Have you just injecterd LSD into my bottom?
[[AQA]]: No, [[AQA]] has not just injected LSD into your bottom, you will have to look elsewhere for the culprit. [[AQA]] does not condone the use of illegal drugs.

MisterJTA: Do not answer this message in any way, shape, or form... Cheery-bye!
[[AQA]]: Sorry, but [[AQA]] has to answer your text, as you have already paid for a reply. All said, goodbye, dear friend, have a lovely evening.

MisterJTA: What does [[Statto]] think about sex?
[[AQA]]: Statto thinks that sex is best done outside, with at least three people. He thinks about it all the time. Look! See! He&#x27;s thinking about it now!!

MisterJTA: Do [[AQA]] researchers ever get fed up with having to answer stupid questions from drunk students, or is it all worth it for the safisfaction of a weird job well done?
[[AQA]]: This researcher is driven by the satisfaction of a job well done, although advising spotty adolescents on their love lives can be stressful at times.
&#x2F;&#x2F;(awwww...)&#x2F;&#x2F;

MisterJTA: How do I get out of *this*?!
[[AQA]]: To get out of *this*, find a large cardboard box. Climb inside it and wait until everybody leaves, or it all blows over. Take sandwiches for a big *this*.

RestlessBoy: What is the funniest thing that&#x27;s ever happened?
[[AQA]]: The funniest thing that&#x27;s ever happened was either Henry V winning at Agincourt, or the car being dumped in Victor Meldrew&#x27;s skip.</script>
