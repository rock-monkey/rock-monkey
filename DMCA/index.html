What does it mean for you? Well, basically it means that you&#x27;re not allowed to circumvent any kind of copy protection on anything you own, even if you want to apply FairUse laws

This means you can&#x27;t crack your DigiBox to get free channels. Fair enough

It also means you can&#x27;t watch your DVDs through anything but an official DVD Player (Official players like Cinemaster, Windvd and Powerdvd pay a license fee). No more Linux player. No more ripping it to your hard drive. That&#x27;s illegal, dontcha know?

You can&#x27;t circumvent the protection on ProtectedMusicCds in order to make an MP3 for your _own use_

Or you&#x27;ll go to jail. Hooray for the [[America land of the free!]]</script>
