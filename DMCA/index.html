    A messy piece of legislature. Europe is quite close to having it&#39;s own, but it keeps being overturned<br />
What does it mean for you? Well, basically it means that you&#39;re not allowed to circumvent any kind of copy protection on anything you own, even if you want to apply <a href="/FairUse" class="internal">FairUse</a> laws<br />
This means you can&#39;t crack your <a href="/DigiBox" class="broken internal">DigiBox</a> to get free channels. Fair enough<br />
It also means you can&#39;t watch your DVDs through anything but an official DVD Player (Official players like Cinemaster, Windvd and Powerdvd pay a license fee). No more Linux player. No more ripping it to your hard drive. That&#39;s illegal, dontcha know?<br />
You can&#39;t circumvent the protection on <a href="/ProtectedMusicCds" class="internal">ProtectedMusicCds</a> in order to make an MP3 for your _own use_<br />
Or you&#39;ll go to jail. Hooray for the <a href="/America" class="internal">land of the free!</a>
