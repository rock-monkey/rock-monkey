    The current <a href="/GuineaPigStrike" class="internal">GuineaPigStrike</a>, which is causing the world-wide shortage of <a href="/MiltonSirotta" class="internal">MiltonSirotta</a>, is a mere ripple effect of the 1983 Guinea Pig Labour Act. This was the act in which <a href="/MargaretThatcher" class="internal">MargaretThatcher</a> decreed that all Guinea Pigs that were not, in fact, from Guinea (except if they were first generation immigrants) should be worked in accordance to the <a href="/BritishPigLaws" class="broken internal">BritishPigLaws</a>, which lead to lower pay, longer hours, and little tiny rashers of bacon.<br />
Now <a href="/GuineaPigs" class="internal">GuineaPigs</a> are a gentle race, and it has taken them over two decades to get suitably worked up about the matter for them to take the radical step of a general strike. This strike means that no more milk would be produced until the little fuzzy workers were promised more pay, shorter hours, the option of <a href="/FlexiTime" class="broken internal">FlexiTime</a>, and the banning of the wanton slaughter of their race for the lucrative mini-bacon trade.<hr />See <a href="/TotalBollocks" class="internal">TotalBollocks</a>, <a href="/Daventry" class="internal">Daventry</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">hurray!
