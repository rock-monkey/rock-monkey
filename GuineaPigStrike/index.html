      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">The current GuineaPigStrike, which is causing the world-wide shortage of MiltonSirotta, is a mere ripple effect of the 1983 Guinea Pig Labour Act. This was the act in which MargaretThatcher decreed that all Guinea Pigs that were not, in fact, from Guinea (except if they were first generation immigrants) should be worked in accordance to the BritishPigLaws, which lead to lower pay, longer hours, and little tiny rashers of bacon.

Now GuineaPigs are a gentle race, and it has taken them over two decades to get suitably worked up about the matter for them to take the radical step of a general strike. This strike means that no more milk would be produced until the little fuzzy workers were promised more pay, shorter hours, the option of FlexiTime, and the banning of the wanton slaughter of their race for the lucrative mini-bacon trade.
