    &quot;The Cockatrice is a rare mythological beast much feared by even the bravest hero. Also known as the King of Serpents in some lands, it is a curious amalgam of a number of different creatures. It has the head and body of a large cockerel, the large leathery wings of a bat, and a long, snake-like tail. It can fly short distances, but will usually strut about on the ground flapping its wings. It is carnivorous, and will fearlessly attack any large creature it encounters.<br />
In an attack a Cockatrice will attempt to peck with its beak... However, the beast also has poisonous breath, which will paralyse anything it comes into contact with. If the Cockatrice hits with its beak, damage is normally dependent on a 2D6 die roll, or a 1 in 12 chance of:<br />
Hit in the brain - instant death<br />
Hit on sword-arm - must use other arm to attack. Lose skill<br />
Hit on back - difficult to move. Lose skill<br />
Hit on left leg - can only limp. Lose skill<br />
Hit on second-arm - cannot use arm. Lose minor skill point<br />
No penalty<br />
Hit in eye - 3D vision gone. Lose skill<br />
Hit on right leg - can only limp. Lose skill<br />
Hit on both legs - cannot move. Lose skill<br />
Hit on both arms - cannot use arms to fight, carry items etc...<br />
Hit in heart - instant death<br />
Anyone caught by the Cockatrice&#39;s breath has a chance of dodging the worst of it [if they are lucky]. Like the Basilisk, to which it is distantly related, the Cockatrice has a major weakness. If it catches sight of its reflection in a mirror or some other reflective surface it will die. Persuading a hungry Cockatrice to stop and look into a mirror requires [the adventurer to be very lucky indeed]. If he fails, the Cockatrice may decide to attack while he is occupied, scoring an *automatic hit*. No one is sure why the thing can be killed in this way, but this knowledge has proved useful to a number of lucky adventurers throughout the years&quot;<br />
