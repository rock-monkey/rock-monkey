    <img src="images/milford.jpg" alt="milford" class="right" /> Strange random (fawxy) young man who appeared on the <a href="/ChatRoom" class="internal">ChatRoom</a> on 21st March 2005, broke <a href="/PassThePageOne07" class="internal">PassThePageOne07</a>, then hung around.<br />
Of his picture, to the right, he said:<br />
//i hope you dont get it too messy when you are jacking off over it tonight!!<br />
&quot;he&#39;s just a luuuuv-machine....oooohy oooooh&quot;//<hr /><a href="/MilfordCubicle" class="internal">MilfordCubicle</a> is also the name of a character in the cult cartoon <a href="/SaladFingers" class="internal">SaladFingers</a>, by <a href="/DavidFirth" class="internal">DavidFirth</a>.<hr /><a href="/MilfordCubicle" class="internal">MilfordCubicle</a> (otherwise known as Necropedonaz) likes baked potatoes<hr />Click <a href="http://necropedonaz.50webs.com/" class="broken external">here</a> to see <a href="/MilfordCubicle" class="internal">MilfordCubicle</a>&#39;s shitty website (I&#39;m just learning how to write html code, so its pretty basic)<hr /><a href="/CategoryWikiPeople" class="internal">List of other people</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I'd be more impressed if you hadn't nicked most of the content (including the images) from Maddox...</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>

Also, er, why HTML? Isn't that on the way out? (and if it isn't, how come I've had to swap an italic tag for an XHTML emphasis tag, and suchlike?)</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Maddox falls under the catagory of www.justfuckinggoogleit.com as it's the first, second AND third results<br />
<br />
XHTML is being developed by people like Dan and Jon who seem to dislike HTML because there are several ways in which it can be interpreted, and it allows mixing of content, structure and presentation into one document, something which is *apparently* a big no-no</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">All XHTML(1) is also HTML. Some HTML is also XHTML. There's a big overlap.<br />
<br />
The major benefits of XHTML are:<br />
<br />
* Seperation of content and presentation logic (which leads to secondary benefits such as improved accessibilty, portable styles, etc.)<br />
* Improved machine-readability (which provides a key step towards the semantic web)</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Ok no offence, but all you nerds can just back off!  I blatantly know feck all about computers, hence the part where i say &quot;im just learning&quot;.  I dont even know what i'm learning whether its HTML or XHTML or whether its quantum physics!   Also, i only stole one or two images from maddox.  The &quot;tube top&quot; one and the &quot;big fucking deal&quot; one, the rest are either ones that i have found on the web, or ones i have created myself in photoshop (eg. tony blair chav one, and mcfaggats one, and of course all of the duncan osgood ones.)  So dont get your panties in a twist folks!  Its just a piss about, im not trying to make an awesome site, because i dont know how to!  Im just messing about, practising my new (so called) skills on the web.</div><cite><a href="/MilfordCubicle">MilfordCubicle</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Oh and i stole the tom clancy plot generator and the valentines day thingy, but i think thats it....yeah ok i did steal a lot, but only coz its so damn funny!  And its not as if im taking credit for it!  <br />

The bulk of people on RockMonkey are either doing ComputerScience, or have done so in the past, or otherwise know more about IT than the average luser too scared to display the system files in Windows in case that caused the computer to blow up -  so I'm afraid a high geekiness content is pretty much a dead cert in the event of anything half-way technical coming up, but that doesn't mean anyone's having a pop at you.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, you're using IE, in which case you're asking for it... ;-)</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Hey I have nothing against computer nerds,  I wish i was a computer nerd.  But im too stupid, and impatient to learn.   It just seemed like you were dissing my blatanly shit site.  I spent a while on it, so its not nice being told its shit, even though it is! <br />
Plus, whoever left a message on the message board as the &quot;maddox love&quot;  smells like poo!   I WILL eventually put more of my own shit on there and remove the stolen shit, but right now, i just want to fill up the site with various stolen garbage, as i am lazy,(Although a lot of the pics and stuff are mine.) and have exams and stuff.  <br />
By the way, Im using a mac and I'm using two internet browsers:  Internet explorer (just to check how the site looks in different browsers, once ive edited a page etc. so dont go tits on me!)  and using Safari as my main browser.  Its a pretty damn good browser, but Internet explorer is shit compared to it.  really slow and crappy toolbars etc.</div><cite><a href="/MilfordCubicle">MilfordCubicle</a></cite></blockquote>
