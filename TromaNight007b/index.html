As you push on, you catch a glimpse of MisterJTA. He&#x27;s fighting the crowd, too: trying to get to the other exit. You shout out to him, but he doesn&#x27;t hear you...

Suddenly, you&#x27;re pushed over, and you feel the feet of the crowd pounding around you. You roll aside and crawl on, dodging legs as you head towards the last position you saw [[MisterJTA JTA]]. There&#x27;s a break in the crowd, and you take your opportunity, leaping up and over a group of schoolchildren and landing hard on the concrete on the other side.

You stand up and dust yourself off. MisterJTA is stood in front of you - you successfully escaped the crowd and found him. As the crowd disperses in it&#x27;s many directions, you realise that you&#x27;ve just managed to find one of the TromaNight crew.
