RazorWire is a particularly vicious variant of BarbedWire which is used to guard the top of fences and discourage humans from climbing them. Rather than a series of distributed sharp barbs, RazorWire is sharp along it&#x27;s entire surface, making it almost impossible to find a safe point to grip. It is significantly harder to errect than BarbedWire, and protective gauntlets are required.</script>
