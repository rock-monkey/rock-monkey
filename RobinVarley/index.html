      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Small brother of RuthVarley, now mentally scarred for life after MisterJTA visited his house for a fortnight in the SummerHolidays.

RobinVarley objects strongly when people are having NoisyNookie in his vicinity. His crowning moment of glory was having NoisyNookie in his room with SomeOne whilst his friend was not asleep on the floor.

Probably a better sport than people give him credit for.
