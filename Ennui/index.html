    Like <a href="/Boring" class="internal">bored</a>, but this is a state of mind which can only be achieved after several hours or even days of <a href="/Boring" class="internal">boredom</a>. None of this (or the following) is official, but I (<a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a>) think it can be described as a separate emotion from <a href="/Boring" class="internal">boredom</a>.<br />
Bring in exhibit A. <a href="/LostInTranslation" class="internal">LostInTranslation</a><br />
This film seems to force people into one of two camps<br />
1. Those who believe the film perfectly describes the feeling of <a href="/Ennui" class="auto-fixed internal">ennui</a><br />
2. Those who believe the film causes <a href="/Ennui" class="auto-fixed internal">ennui</a><br />
We don&#39;t like the second kind of people.<br />
Exhibit B. Roman hedonists (See <a href="/HedonistBot" class="broken internal">HedonistBot</a>) would often attempt to make themselves deliberately bored. This requires more concentration and effort (not to mention time) than most people are prepared to give, so it hasn&#39;t been practiced much since<br />
Exhibit C. <a href="/TheGame" class="internal">TheGame</a>. Surely something as simple, yet engrossing can only come from <a href="/Ennui" class="auto-fixed internal">ennui</a>. Anything which relieves boredom yet requires effort defeats its own purpose.<br />
In modern society, it is difficult to achieve a state of <a href="/Ennui" class="auto-fixed internal">ennui</a>, but it is greatly rewarding for small periods at a time (except for the people who call you lazy)<hr /><a href="/CategoryEmotions" class="internal">ennui is an emotion</a>
