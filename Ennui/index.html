      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Like [[Boring bored]], but this is a state of mind which can only be achieved after several hours or even days of [[Boring boredom]]. None of this (or the following) is official, but I (PaulMann) think it can be described as a separate emotion from [[Boring boredom]].

Bring in exhibit A. LostInTranslation

This film seems to force people into one of two camps

1. Those who believe the film perfectly describes the feeling of [[ennui]]

2. Those who believe the film causes [[ennui]]

We don&#x27;t like the second kind of people.

Exhibit B. Roman hedonists (See HedonistBot) would often attempt to make themselves deliberately bored. This requires more concentration and effort (not to mention time) than most people are prepared to give, so it hasn&#x27;t been practiced much since

Exhibit C. TheGame. Surely something as simple, yet engrossing can only come from [[ennui]]. Anything which relieves boredom yet requires effort defeats its own purpose.

In modern society, it is difficult to achieve a state of [[ennui]], but it is greatly rewarding for small periods at a time (except for the people who call you lazy)
