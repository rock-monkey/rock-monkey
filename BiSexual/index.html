Sexuality waning in popularity as the fad comes to an end (see PromoSexual).

A person who is [[BiSexual bisexual]] is sexually attracted to members of either sex. This can lead to a great deal of confusion, particularly by people who decide that this means that they &quot;can&#x27;t make up thier minds&quot; or assume that they are therefore actually [[Gay gay]] or [[Straight straight]].

WoodyAllen said, &quot;[[BiSexual Bisexuality]] immediately doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.&quot; This statement fails to take in to account...

~- Basic mathematics: it would be true only if everybody you knew was a viable date - however, statistically, most people are HeteroSexual, which dramatically reduces the number of people of your own gender who might want to go out with you anyway.

~- Human nature: the things a BiSexual person finds attractive in one gender may be entirely different to those they find attractive in another. This may reduce the potential &#x27;pool&#x27; of candidate dates from either or both genders.

~- TromaNight: as everybody knows, you shouldn&#x27;t be looking for a date on Saturday nights, because you&#x27;ll end up bringing them along to TromaNight, and as [[LizHague Liz]] will testify: this is a quick way to scare a date off.

~-[[Wrong And you can&#x27;t double zero :-)]]

And the definition of &quot;cutting,&quot; because I'm not sure a comment can be cutting unless it's cutting towards someone specific.<br />

But it's a tolerable sentence, and it does its job well.</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I think a survey would find that it is accurate to say that bisexuality as a sexual preference is failing to gain popularity at the rate it once did, and that this correlates with the popular definition of bisexuality being 'cool'.<br />

That's not to state that the two are related, of course - but that's what I was not-so subtley implying.</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
