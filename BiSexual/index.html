    Sexuality waning in popularity as the fad comes to an end (see <a href="/PromoSexual" class="internal">PromoSexual</a>).<br />
A person who is <a href="/BiSexual" class="internal">bisexual</a> is sexually attracted to members of either sex. This can lead to a great deal of confusion, particularly by people who decide that this means that they &quot;can&#39;t make up thier minds&quot; or assume that they are therefore actually <a href="/Gay" class="internal">gay</a> or <a href="/Straight" class="broken internal">straight</a>.<hr /><a href="/WoodyAllen" class="broken internal">WoodyAllen</a> said, &quot;<a href="/BiSexual" class="internal">Bisexuality</a> immediately doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.&quot; This statement fails to take in to account...<br />
<ul><li> Basic mathematics: it would be true only if everybody you knew was a viable date - however, statistically, most people are <a href="/HeteroSexual" class="internal">HeteroSexual</a>, which dramatically reduces the number of people of your own gender who might want to go out with you anyway.</li><li> Human nature: the things a <a href="/BiSexual" class="internal">BiSexual</a> person finds attractive in one gender may be entirely different to those they find attractive in another. This may reduce the potential &#39;pool&#39; of candidate dates from either or both genders.</li><li> <a href="/TromaNight" class="internal">TromaNight</a>: as everybody knows, you shouldn&#39;t be looking for a date on Saturday nights, because you&#39;ll end up bringing them along to <a href="/TromaNight" class="internal">TromaNight</a>, and as <a href="/LizHague" class="internal">Liz</a> will testify: this is a quick way to scare a date off.</li><li><a href="/Wrong" class="internal">And you can&#39;t double zero :-)</a><hr /><a href="/CategorySexualities" class="internal">CategorySexualities</a></ul><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I don't like the first sentence in this article. Other than that, it's quite good</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I do. It seems to be accurate, cutting, and funny. What more does it need?</div><cite><a href="/217.140.43.3">217.140.43.3</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Er. I'd question the definition of &quot;accurate&quot; in that sentence.<br />
<br />
And the definition of &quot;cutting,&quot; because I'm not sure a comment can be cutting unless it's cutting towards someone specific.<br />
<br />
But it's a tolerable sentence, and it does its job well.</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I think a survey would find that it is accurate to say that bisexuality as a sexual preference is failing to gain popularity at the rate it once did, and that this correlates with the popular definition of bisexuality being 'cool'.<br />
<br />
That's not to state that the two are related, of course - but that's what I was not-so subtley implying.</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Ah. Well I was never made aware that being bisexual used to be growing in popularity more than it did now. Or, indeed, that the popularities of sexualities grew or waned at all, come to that. Or that being bisexual was 'cooler' than being anything else. <br />
<br />
Is there a general summary of popular culture post-1969 that I could somehow catch up on?</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Fuck knows; but there was certainly a time during the 90s during which bisexuality suddenly became &quot;the new black&quot;, leading to thousands of teenagers without the slightest homosexual inclination to declare themselves bisexual. Happily little anarchic teenagers. &lt;sighs&gt;</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote></div>
