    <h3><a href="/Grue" class="internal">Grue</a></h3>As transcribed from the <a href="/EncyclopaediaFrobozzica" class="broken internal">EncyclopaediaFrobozzica</a>, a compilation of all things from the <a href="/GreatUndergroundEmpire" class="broken internal">GreatUndergroundEmpire</a>, also known as &quot;<a href="/Zork" class="internal">Zork</a>&quot;.<hr />The <a href="/Grue" class="internal">grue</a> is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its horrible fear of light. No <a href="/Grue" class="internal">grues</a> have ever been seen by the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground lairs. Of those who have seen <a href="/Grue" class="internal">grues</a>, few ever survived their fearsome jaws to tell the tale.<br />
<a href="/Grue" class="internal">Grues</a> have sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. &quot;Sour as a <a href="/Grue" class="internal">grue</a>&quot; is a common expression, even among themselves.<hr /><a href="/CategoryCreatures" class="internal">See other fictional creatures</a>
