----
The [[Grue grue]] is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its horrible fear of light. No [[Grue grues]] have ever been seen by the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground lairs. Of those who have seen [[Grue grues]], few ever survived their fearsome jaws to tell the tale.

[[Grue Grues]] have sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. &quot;Sour as a [[Grue grue]]&quot; is a common expression, even among themselves.
