BillHicks was a StandUpComic who lived out much of his career in relative anonymity. He grew up in a God-fearing Texan family and after developing a gift for stand-up at school he would sneek out of his room at night to perform in his local comedy club.

After dropping out of college BillHicks moved to LosAngeles to begin his career but soon left for NewYork, partially due to the fact that LosAngeles weather did not agree with his dress sense. Whilst Hicks would do spectacularly in a club atmosphere his extreme opposition to commercialism kept him out of the [[TV]] scene by not only the reluctance of [[TV]] executives to pick him up but with his vehement distaste to his being censored or controlled in any way.

A comedy special that he did do for [[TV]] in America was broadcast on ChannelFour over here unedited leading to a much more informed opinion of his act (viewers of Hicks&#x27; [[TV]] special in America were shocked by his vulgarity and eviscerative dealing of hecklers when they saw him live) and hence a distinct cult following. This British cult following was great enough to warrant a limited tour.

The majority of Hicks&#x27; act centred around satirising and criticising the government, media and just about any institution larger than an individual with occasional, improvised flights of fancy. He was a distinctive voice in favour of drug taking, yet another factor that kept him from mainstream comedy. He stressed that drugs had positive effects as well as negative and highlighted the media bias in only covering the negative.

Towards the end of his unfortunately and unnaturally short career his act became more refined and more pointed in it&#x27;s satire and relied less upon vulgarity and irreverence however he suffered a massive blow to his confidence when a set that he performmed for his friend [[DavidLettermansLateShow]] was unbroadcast for vague reasons by uncertain persons. He felt betrayed by a friend, doubly so in that he couldn&#x27;t find out who had called for the censure. He refused to perform again for the show, despite a number of invitations, and went back to comedy clubs. During what was to be his last performance he simply stopped in the middle of hsi set, called his agent to the front and said that he was done. Few knew what he knew.

He died of pancreatic cancer on the 26th of February 1996.</script>
