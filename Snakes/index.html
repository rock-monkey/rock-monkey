There is no reason to be afraid of snakes. Most snakes you encounter are not poisonous, and are more scared of you than you are of them. Just leave them alone and stop poking them with sticks and we&#x27;ll all get along much nicer. Okay?

They are NOT [[BasiliskLizard basilisks]] despite what HarryPotter says. They usually eat birds, insects and eggs. Snake digestion is ridiculously inefficient, absorbing everything except claws and hair. They are not slimy, but they are cold-blooded. Some snakes can see in Infra-red

Snakes smell by flicking their tongue to collect airborne particles. If you are bitten by a snake, you can _not_ suck out the venom with your mouth, as the venom will pass through your circulatory system in a matter of seconds. However, of the 7000 Americans who are bitten by snakes each year, less than 15 die. You&#x27;re more likely to die by eating one and becoming infected with parasites

List of aggressive, venemous snakes: 

~- Cobras
~- Mambas
~- Death Adders
~- Vipers
~- Tiger Snakes
~- Rattle Snakes
~- Coral Snakes

Most of these are _very_ small. The larger ones tend to constrict you instead. But only if they feel threatened or surprised.
