Seriously, it&#x27;s quite difficult to get a modern PC which doesn&#x27;t come with it pre-installed. And you payed for that in the price

Why does it always seem to come pre-installed? Well, Microsoft offer a massive discount to manufacturers if all the PCs they sell ship with their OperatingSystem. If even one of them doesn&#x27;t, Microsoft don&#x27;t offer the discount. Simple as that. And since most people still want MicrosoftWindows (even if it&#x27;s just for the assurance of something familiar) the retailer doesn&#x27;t have much of a choice

Will be replaced by WindowsLonghorn when they finally get around to releasing it

Quite similar to [[Windows2000]] on the inside, but prettier and with additional features such as a bastardised version of [[VDMSound]] 

Includes rudimentary [[DRM]] and TrustedComputing

No wonder more people are switching to [[Linux]]</script>
