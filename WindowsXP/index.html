    Remember kids, just say no!<br />
Seriously, it&#39;s quite difficult to get a modern PC which doesn&#39;t come with it pre-installed. And you payed for that in the price<br />
Why does it always seem to come pre-installed? Well, Microsoft offer a massive discount to manufacturers if all the PCs they sell ship with their <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a>. If even one of them doesn&#39;t, Microsoft don&#39;t offer the discount. Simple as that. And since most people still want <a href="/MicrosoftWindows" class="internal">MicrosoftWindows</a> (even if it&#39;s just for the assurance of something familiar) the retailer doesn&#39;t have much of a choice<br />
Will be replaced by <a href="/WindowsLonghorn" class="internal">WindowsLonghorn</a> when they finally get around to releasing it<br />
Quite similar to <a href="/Windows2000" class="internal">Windows2000</a> on the inside, but prettier and with additional features such as a bastardised version of <a href="/VDMSound" class="broken internal">VDMSound</a> <br />
Includes rudimentary <a href="/DRM" class="internal">DRM</a> and <a href="/TrustedComputing" class="internal">TrustedComputing</a><br />
No wonder more people are switching to <a href="/Linux" class="internal">Linux</a>
