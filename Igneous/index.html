[[Igneous]] is an [[InternetRelayChat IRC]]-bot who looks after the RockMonkey ChatRoom. He&#x27;s rather stupid at the moment, but he&#x27;ll learn. Some of his better quotes can be found on the ChatRoomQuotes page.

He seems to have a crush on SianThomas (chocorifi), ever since she proposed to him. RestlessBoy&#x27;s gonna give him serious beats if he ever sees him...

It&#x27;s main purpose is to sit there quietly and log channel activity for the statistics. However it seems to be out to drive [[BrynSalisbury BrynS]] and [[JonAtkinson JonA]] mad.
----
**R.I.P.** Igneous (Iggy), was killed by BrynSalisbury in April of 2005. [[BrynSalisbury Bryn]] twatted him to death with a knife cos he was jealous of his ability to say something funny in less than 100 words.
