    <h3><a href="/Igneous" class="internal">Igneous</a></h3><a href="/Igneous" class="internal">Igneous</a> is an <a href="/InternetRelayChat" class="internal">IRC</a>-bot who looks after the <a href="/RockMonkey" class="internal">RockMonkey</a> <a href="/ChatRoom" class="internal">ChatRoom</a>. He&#39;s rather stupid at the moment, but he&#39;ll learn. Some of his better quotes can be found on the <a href="/ChatRoomQuotes" class="internal">ChatRoomQuotes</a> page.<br />
He seems to have a crush on <a href="/SianThomas" class="internal">SianThomas</a> (chocorifi), ever since she proposed to him. <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>&#39;s gonna give him serious beats if he ever sees him...<br />
It&#39;s main purpose is to sit there quietly and log channel activity for the statistics. However it seems to be out to drive <a href="/BrynSalisbury" class="internal">BrynS</a> and <a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonA</a> mad.<hr /><strong>R.I.P.</strong> Igneous (Iggy), was killed by <a href="/BrynSalisbury" class="internal">BrynSalisbury</a> in April of 2005. <a href="/BrynSalisbury" class="internal">Bryn</a> twatted him to death with a knife cos he was jealous of his ability to say something funny in less than 100 words. <hr /><a href="/InternetRelayChat" class="internal">Back to other pages on IRC</a>
