    <a href="/Microsoft" class="internal">Microsoft</a> was the name given to a particularly bizzare side-show act which enjoyed vast popularity in Ludlow in the seventeenth century. It consisted of a dwarf with a floppy felt hat sewn to his head; the story went that he&#39;d angered a seamstress by refusing to model for her and she had sewn the hat to him as revenge, finishing with a knot on the inside so the stitches couldn&#39;t come unpicked.<br />
In 1974 this was proven to be an elementary fake; the enterprising dwarf had simply built a time machine, travelled to the future, befriended an SF make-up artist, and convinced them to draw on the stitches in a convincing way.<hr />See also <a href="/MicrosoftCorporation" class="internal">MicrosoftCorporation</a>.<hr />See <a href="/TotalBollocks" class="internal">TotalBollocks</a>
