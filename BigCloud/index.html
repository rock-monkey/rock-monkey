The BigCloud is a metaphor for all the pages in a wiki which are, by some means or another, linked to one another in the large bulk of the wiki. There are several smaller clouds (usually of only two or three [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] each, linked to one another) outlying the BigCloud, and there are a reasonable number of OrphanedPages ([[WIkiPage WikiPages]] with no links to them whatsoever) on the outskirts.

The addition of the &quot;Links Here&quot; links on [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] and the OrphanedPages&#x2F;BadPages pages were supposed to alleviate the problem of OrphanedPages, but have met with limited success. There is currently a debate on the [[OrphanedPagesProblem]] and how to solve it.
