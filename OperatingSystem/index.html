An OperatingSystem is a low-level [[API]] designed to allow a programmer or user to manipulate the physical hardware without having to know exactly how it works

The term has become very vague in recent years, particularly when products like WindowsMe came around

Basic components of an OperatingSystem are as follows:

~- A memory module, designed to allocate physical memory to programs, keep track of it, and prevent them overwriting each others memory

~- A task scheduler, which allows the running of more than one program and distributes CPU time as it sees fit

~- An I&#x2F;O interface of some kind. This could be keyboard input or disk access in certain circumstances

These form what is known as the kernel

Everything else could be termed an OperatingEnvironment, or an addition to the OperatingSystem, but not an OS itself. There are of course exceptions, and some OSs like Linux include networking, which may be a seperate module in others</script>
