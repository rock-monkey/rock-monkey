    <a href="/ComputerScienceStudents" class="internal">Compscis</a>, please don&#39;t flame me for over simplifying, or being &quot;not-quite&quot; correct. I&#39;ve tried to avoid using jargon where possible and make it as easy to understand as possible - <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">Paul</a><br />
An <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a> is a low-level <a href="/API" class="internal">API</a> designed to allow a programmer or user to manipulate the physical hardware without having to know exactly how it works<br />
The term has become very vague in recent years, particularly when products like <a href="/WindowsMe" class="broken internal">WindowsMe</a> came around<br />
Basic components of an <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a> are as follows:<ul></li><li> A memory module, designed to allocate physical memory to programs, keep track of it, and prevent them overwriting each others memory</li><li> A task scheduler, which allows the running of more than one program and distributes CPU time as it sees fit</li><li> An I/O interface of some kind. This could be keyboard input or disk access in certain circumstances</li></ul>These form what is known as the kernel<br />
Everything else could be termed an <a href="/OperatingEnvironment" class="internal">OperatingEnvironment</a>, or an addition to the <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a>, but not an OS itself. There are of course exceptions, and some OSs like Linux include networking, which may be a seperate module in others
