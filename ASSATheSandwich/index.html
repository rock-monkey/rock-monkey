Sandwich created by PaulMann, AndyKeohane, FayeBromilow, and BrynSalisbury in [[MGeesCafe]] on 30th April 2005. 

In the spirit of [[ASSA]] the content of the sandwich was decided by each of the four participants contributing one of the fillings without knowledge of what the others had picked. 

Hence the sandwich contained Salmon, Sweetcorn, Lettuce and Cranberry.

The sandwich was prepared by AndyRegan and taken from the cafÃƒÂ© by PaulMann.

At the time of writing the sandwich has not yet been consumed. It is PaulMann&#x27;s intention that it be consumed at TromaNight.
