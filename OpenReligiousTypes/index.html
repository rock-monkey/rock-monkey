    Generally; someone who has ideas rather than beliefs (see <a href="/Dogma" class="broken internal">Dogma</a>), someone who is not afraid to be wrong about their religion, someone who is not afraid of what people say about their religion (see <a href="/JerrySpringerTheOpera" class="broken internal">JerrySpringerTheOpera</a> and <a href="/MontyPython" class="internal">MontyPython</a>&#39;s <a href="/LifeOfBrian" class="internal">LifeOfBrian</a>).<hr /><a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a> : I hope that&#39;s me, i keep my persecuting down to an absolute minimum these days ;-)<br />
I do have beliefs, without them I don&#39;t think you can have religion/spirituality, all you have is philosophy, which is noble but different, but those beliefs are fluid and lacking in theological dogma.<br />
