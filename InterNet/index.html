Previously they used [[Drugs drugs]] and [[Alcohol alcohol]] to do the same thing. However some people were put off [[drugs]] because they were illegal, and [[Alcohol alcohol]] was proven to be bad for health. [[Television]] worked for a time but lacked the interactive element which made people feel they were achieving something. It was also easier for people to BuyThings from the [[Internet]] than from [[Television television]].
