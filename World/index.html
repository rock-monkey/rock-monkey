The Earth was created by the inhabitants of a nearby star, as an experiment in GeneticEngineering. Scientists set up the test to see if life could adapt to such harsh conditions. It took several attempts, but finally an obscure combinaton of rare proteins was discovered which developed into something approximating to [[Life]]. However, the project was hugely controversial and the funding was pulled before the scientists had time to clear up after themselves, and sadly the rather promising new lifeforms degenerated into something unpleasant over time.
