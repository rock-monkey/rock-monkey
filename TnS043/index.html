&quot;Ok.&quot; You say.

The guard looks furtively about, before coming closer. &quot;Ok,&quot; he whispers, &quot;once you&#x27;ve got the salt, look for Topplin&#x27; Tom. Tell him that you have the merchandise. He will reply by saying that demand always exceeds supply. You must then say, &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s life&#x27;, and he will tell you what to do next. Got that?&quot;

You nod.

He takes something from a pocket and hands it to you. It&#x27;s a small, brass key. &quot;You will need this to open the boat-house, without it you will never get across the swamp. Good luck!&quot;

He shakes your hand, and then turns back to the wall.
