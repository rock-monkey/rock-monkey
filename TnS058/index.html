    <h1>Marketplace</h1>Just as the old elf starts to climb out from under the stall, you grab the money bag and stuff it into your utility belt, where it creates a suspicious bulge. You wish briefly that your costume wasn&#39;t made from skin-tight lycra...<br />
<br />
The elf appears on the other side of the stall and dusts himself down. He starts talking again.<br />
&quot;Now then, young squirrel. What can I do for you?&quot; He looks at the stall for a minute. &quot;Strange, my bag of toenail clippings seems to have gone...&quot;<br />
<hr />What now?<br />
<a href="/TnS002" class="internal">Leave</a><br />
Talk:<br />
<a href="/TnS060" class="broken internal">&#39;Who are you?&#39;</a><br />
<a href="/TnS061" class="broken internal">&#39;Why aren&#39;t there any other elves about? This is a marketplace isn&#39;t it?&#39;</a><br />
<a href="/TnS062" class="broken internal">&#39;I&#39;m here investigating a distress call. You wouldn&#39;t know anything about it, would you?&#39;</a>
