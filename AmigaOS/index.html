    Operating System used by the <a href="/Amiga" class="internal">Amiga</a> range of home computers<h3>Kickstart and Workbench versions</h3>Kickstart - The kernel. In ROM, except for the A1000<br />
Workbench - The user interface, invoked with the command &quot;loadwb&quot;, although a good chunk of it loads anyway to give you the CLI. On disk.<br />
Any workbench version can be used as long as it&#39;s major release (number before the decimal point) matches that of the Kickstart<br />
Noteable releases:<ul></li><li> Kickstart 1.2 - Brilliant white opening screen showing a hand holding a disk. Catchy. Little hard drive support, but it was there. Workbench was a deliberate high-constrast thing of blue and orange. Quite painful to use, and no support to create a new directory. You had to duplicate an existing one. Also, deleted items *had* to be dragged to a trashcan. If there wasn&#39;t a trashcan on your disk, you couldn&#39;t delete. No commands in memory, not even CD. Two floppy drives or a hard drive essential if you wanted to do anything remotely serious</li><li> Kickstart 1.3 - Almost identical, but it supported bootable hard drives.</li><li> Kickstart 2.04 - Low contrast pleasant black/white/grey appearance. Boot screen changed to a purple animation of a disk being inserted into a drive. Introduced delete and new folder commands. Made a lot of commands resident, such as cd, so no need to keep reinserting the Workbench disk. Strangely, commands such as DIR were still disk-based. What most non-Amiga users will be familiar with, due to the popularity of the A500+ and the A600</li><li> Kickstart 3.01 - Very similar in appearance to 2.04, but the changes under the bonnet were quite significant. Firstly was the support for cd drives, even bootable ones with 3.01 (as opposed to 3.0). Support for graphics cards like the Picasso (see later). Secondly was the introduction of &quot;datatypes&quot;. This is essentially identical to the &quot;class-type&quot; idea on PCs, whereby a file _type_ could be assosciated with a program. Small moves... Moved a lot of boot-files to the ROM to increase speed<h3>Guru Meditation</h3>If a software failure caused the Amiga to reboot, a flashing red box appeared with the phrase &quot;Guru Meditation&quot;. This is supposed to be relaxing. The following codes described the error code and location in memory where it happened. Not much consolation to know that error 0x00000003 means divide by zero when you&#39;ve just lost 12 hours work. Replaced by &quot;Software Failure&quot; with Workbench 2.04<h3>Methodology</h3>Devices and APIs were handled in a very dynamic way by the Amiga. Upon bootup, a variety of directories would be checked:</li></ul>The C directory, contained commands which could be called from the command line. The default path would point here<br />
The DEVS directory contained drivers for devices (not hard or floppy drives) which might be connected. They had catchy names such as cd.device or scsi.device<br />
The L directory contained disk-validator, a file used to check integrity of the disk. Luckily this silly idea was abolished with Kickstart 2.04<br />
The LIBS directory contained the API for the OS. Some were fairly sensible, such as ARP.library (later ASL.library) (the GUI), and powerpacker.library (for on the fly decompression), to the bizarre mathieeeedoubbas.library and mathieeeedoubbtrans.library (maths functions, I presume)<br />
The S directory contained the catchily-named startup.sequence which was a script called upon bootup<br />
The T directory was always a mystery to me since I never found anything in it<br />
The Amiga never used extensions to identify filetypes. Instead, it relied on the application checking the first few bytes of the file before using it. Hey, it worked. Once datatypes were introduced, the OS could identify and assosciate files on the same principle<br />
This does mean that executable files had to be tagged as such (with the X flag) otherwise the OS would not know they weren&#39;t data files<br />
Another flag was the S tag, which meant the file contained a list of commands (like a batch file) to run. If you didn&#39;t set the flag, you could still treat a file as such with the EXECUTE command<br />
Native support for PC disks (double density only)<br />
The Amiga uses the same CR/LF format as Unix, so there is no problem reading ASCII files. A tool called Crossdos could be invoked to run in the background (like a daemon or TSR), which would silently convert the end of line characters for you. Wasn&#39;t that nice? It also uses Unix backslashes, and many of the commands have similar attributes and names.
