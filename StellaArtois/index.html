[[StellaArtois]] is a Belgian beer, usually around 6.5%. It has a very strong flavour, and it&#x27;s quite fizzy. It also takes quite a while to settle. It is often responsible for the worst type of [[HangOver hangover]], the &quot;[[StangOver stangover]]&quot;.

Known in many northern towns as &quot;wife-beater&quot;. It&#x27;s not uncommon to hear people at the bar make requests such as &quot;a pint of wife-beater, mate&quot;. This is presumably because the highly alcoholic nature of Stella, which makes people violent towards their spouses. I can&#x27;t confirm this. Honest.

No. Despite that being what you told me to ask for at the bar in Scholars. Luckily I got someone else to order it in case the barman turned be down because I wasn't manly enough...</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote></div>
