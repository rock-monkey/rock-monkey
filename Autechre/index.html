    The epitome of cutting edge <a href="/Electronica" class="internal">electronica</a>. <a href="/Autechre" class="internal">Autechre</a> (short for Audio Technology Research and usually pronounced Aw-teck-er) make <a href="/Computer" class="internal">computer</a>-generated music based on algorythmic patterns. Full of the &#39;glitchy&#39; sounds which have become the staple of lesser acts they are a difficult listen and their output does tend to blur into one.<br />
Their best album is known variously as &#39;LP5&#39; &#39;<a href="/Autechre" class="internal">Autechre</a>&#39; and &#39;the Black Album&#39; - because it comes in an opaque black plastic jewel case which says &#39;autechre&#39; on it and nothing else.<br />
Responsibly also for &#39;Gantz_Graf&#39; a track seemingly consisting of random electronic <a href="/Noise" class="internal">noise</a> until watched in tandem with its amazing <a href="http://www.warprecords.com/news/?offset=0&amp;ti_id=840&amp;filter=warp" class="broken external">video</a> featuring a shape which moves in response to the music and which reveals the track to be an astoundingly intricate and structured piece.<br />
They were hugely influential on <a href="/RadioHead" class="auto-fixed internal">Radiohead</a>&#39;s transition into a more <a href="/Electronica" class="internal">electronica</a>-based act.<br />
They are on <a href="/WarpRecords" class="internal">WarpRecords</a>.<br />
they also record as <a href="/Gescom" class="internal">Gescom</a><hr />see <a href="/IDM" class="internal">IDM</a><hr /><a href="/CategoryBands" class="internal">CategoryBands</a>
