AKA the FleebleWidget. No-one knows why.

RuthVarley is known for running around the RockMonkey wiki and putting the word &#x27;[[Lesbians]]&#x27; onto as many pages as is possible. Nobody truly knows why she is so obsessed with [[Lesbia]].

Needs to realise that putting the word [[Lesbians]] on every page is annoying SomePeople.

RuthVarley is well known for never wearing any underwear.

Everybody should ReadThisPage

VoteForRuth to survive AfterTheQuake. Or UnVoteForRuth, if you&#x27;re a mean bastard.

Feeling unloved because everybody [[UnVoteForRuth wants her to die]]. Going to sit in a corner and sulk.

It&#x27;s not that people want you to die, Ruth - it&#x27;s just that people feel the need to counteract the &#x27;vote fiddling&#x27; that you [[VoteForRuth already confessed to]] planning.

[[RuthVarley Ruth]] is the expert at TotalBollocks.
