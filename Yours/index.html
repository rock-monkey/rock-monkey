  <section>
    &#39;Yours&#39; is a fun game to play with people in the street.<br />
The game is not particularly politically correct, nor is it a game which you can play in polite company. The game revolves around the concept of a non-existant sticker album. The object of the game is to collect ugly people and put them into your non-existant album. Rules do, however, apply:<br />
* You can only call females, unless the person is a well-known figure, in which case males are allowed.<br />
* You can&#39;t call anyone over the age of your own grandmother<br />
* Or, indeed, younger than your youngest sibling (if you have none, say about 14 years old).<br />
The method of playing the game is simple. While you&#39;re walking around, and you see an ugly (or odd, poor, homeless, chav-ish etc) person, you have to be the first person in your group of players to call that person and &#39;give&#39; them to another player to put in their album. You need to call people in a certain way, however. The two phrases considered acceptable by the International Yours Foundation include:<br />
* &quot;Yours!&quot;<br />
* &quot;That one&#39;s yours, mate.&quot;<br />
Other local variations apply (we at the International Yours Foundation would like to see a localised Welsh version, for example), but in competition these are currently the only acceptable means of assigning points.<br />
The game is scored in a fairly loose manner. The person who is currently &#39;winning&#39; is often the person who called the most recent ugly person. In other situations, the leader is the person who has called the most ugly people that day. In situations where all players spot the same person at the same time, it is the person who manages to shout the phrase fastest or loudest who takes the lead. Bonus points can be gained by calling the person from within earshot; if you can manage to call a person from right next to them, you take the lead. This, of course, runs the risk of the other players spotting that person first. This can lead to exciting games where reflexes are the key.<br />
Now, for some examples.<br />

This one is yours. Note the overweight nature of this beast, along with the terrible clothes and badly chosen glasses.<br />

This one is also yours. In this case, she is both ugly, fat, AND odd. This monster scored highly.<br />

This foul stain also scored well. Burberry gains extra points, as due to the aggressive nature of the chav, calling one in it&#39;s natural habital (pictured here at the watering hole) can result in fisticuffs.<br />

This is an example as a male yours. Prescott scores big points due to his fame and aggressive northern boorishness. Calling Prescott in the street would very probably promote you to the current &#39;winner&#39;. <br />

This would be a stunning call. Note the gold chains, excessive make-up and clear social deprivation.<br />

One of these ladies is &#39;yours&#39;, one is not. Can you guess which?<br />
