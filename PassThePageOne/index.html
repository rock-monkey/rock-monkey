**(Read [[PassThePageGame this page]] first.)**

Finally almost finished. When it is the completed story will appear [[PassThePageOneComplete here]]. If Dan can do some clever script thing to de-secure it all that would be good.

[[PassThePageOne01 Our story is about...]] (RuthVarley)
[[PassThePageOne02 What they did...]] (DanHuntley)
[[PassThePageOne03 Where they did it...]] (RestlessBoy)
[[PassThePageOne04 Then someone else came along, who was it...?]] (MisterJTA)
[[PassThePageOne05 And they did this...]] (written by anon [but owned by RestlessBoy - hmm...][I took ownership because it was created anonymously so it wasn&#x27;t read-secured])
[[PassThePageOne06 Then what happened...]] (AndyKeohane)
[[PassThePageOne07 Suddenly...]] (borked by [[MilfordCubicle Milford]] - someone please redo, MattInTheHat filled it in but couldn&#x27;t change the security tag. **Please do not read and finish the game.**)
[[PassThePageOne08 The result was...]] (JimmyCarter)
