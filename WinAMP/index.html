====WinAMP 2.0====
The &quot;classic&quot; player. Free. Included native support for MP3, Wave and MIDI. That&#x27;s about it. Then you can add any number of plugins including input formats (MOD, TFMX, LiquidAudio, all sorts), output formats (MP3 creator, gapless output), visualisation and DSP (speed control, vocal remover). Massively popular

====WinAMP 3.0====
A mistake. They included video support. It became slow, clunky, and crashed a lot. The developers realised that people didn&#x27;t like it much, and WinAMP 2 was still available from their site (and indeed, was still being developed, right up to 2.91)

Aka &quot;Wasabi Player&quot;. But Wasabi isn&#x27;t nice. And neither is this. The developers are now working on Wasabi which is open source, because....

====WinAMP 5.0====
They sold out to AOL, who spiced up WinAMP 3.0 and made it the only version you could get. They started including CD-ripping support, CD-burning support, and all sorts of garbage. It&#x27;s not like MusicMatchJukebox. Oh, now it&#x27;s pay-for. Joy.

WinAMP 5.0 has a recommended spec as 1.5Ghz, 128Mb of RAM and 30Mb of HD space. It&#x27;s also, not entirely backwards compatible with the plug-ins. And security flaws have started appearing. Hmm...</script>
