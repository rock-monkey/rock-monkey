    <h4>Hints and Tips for <a href="/TheRevengeOfZanatoth" class="internal">TheRevengeOfZanatoth</a></h4><h5>Levels</h5>The game works on many levels. It also has three levels. The first and thrid take place in same location. The second takes place in a completely different location.<br />
To complete each level there is one basic task to do.<br />
Level One: find <a href="/PeterHain" class="internal">PeterHain</a>&#39;s whereabouts<br />
Level Two: Rescue <a href="/PeterHain" class="internal">PeterHain</a><br />
Level Three: Defeat Zanatoth.<br />
You will not be able to travel to the location in Level Two until you have completed Level One, and you will not be able to come back until you have rescued <a href="/PeterHain" class="internal">PeterHain</a>. <h5>Objects</h5>Some of the Objects you will get in the game are not objects as such but things which change your status, or indicate what you&#39;ve learned. For example you will collect a number of &#39;Vital Clues&#39; which you can&#39;t drop or give to people, but which you can discuss with people. <br />
Another example: one of the first things you will need to get in the game is &#39;Sailors Trust&#39; which will then change any conversations you may have with sailors.<h5>Stuck?</h5>If you get stuck, try talking to some people you haven&#39;t talked to for a while. They may have something new to say to you.<br />
For actual physical objects, each one has a use. If you&#39;re not sure what to do with it then try talking to <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a> (but you&#39;ll have to find him first).<br />
A lot of the solutions to problems are quite bizarre. There are further hints within the game, so read each page in full. <h5>Continuity</h5>Do not expect too much plot continuity between this game and <a href="/RestlessWorld" class="internal">RestlessWorld</a>.
