    <h3><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;the restless corporation&quot;})</div></h3>Look at the warm soothing blue of the above font. Look at the muted, tasteful tones of the background of this page. Do you feel relaxed? Then we&#39;ll begin.<br />
The Restless Corporation is either an exciting dynamic new company (think about fucking someone with brightly coloured clothes in a carpark while techno music plays and you are zoomed at by multiple camera angles) or a long established and trusted brand name, (think about a yorkshire pudding with gravy).<br />
We either put the needs of you the customer or you our potential shareholder first.<br />
We supply either products or services or both or neither or a brand which people either trust or want to buy.<br />
Our long term strategy is either to screw every penny we can out of whatever it is we actually sell or to create the lifestyle <strong><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;red&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;you funky fresh j&amp;#39;s&quot;})</div></strong> are after.<br />
Our product or service or sense of belonging is there to make people feel they have some semblance of control over their own life, their own decisions, their own <a href="/Subconcious" class="broken internal">subconscious</a>. By pricing our products at way over what they are worth we make sure we make the absolute maximum profit, and ensure you know you are getting a quality/exclusive item. <br />
We also make them shoddy so they fall to bits, meaning you have to buy our newer product and reminding you that all existence is transitory and that the only evidence that there will ever be of your mediocre life is the <a href="/CarBootSale" class="broken internal">CarBootSale</a> a month or two after your <a href="/Funeral" class="broken internal">funeral</a>. You wouldn&#39;t want there to be only a small sad bundle of possesions left behind would you? No. Much better to buy whatever it is we&#39;re referring to then take it home and lick it whilst crying and masturbating than to risk connecting with your family and neighbours. After all <em>they</em> could <a href="/Death" class="broken internal">die</a> and then where would you be? All alone and product free. <br />
Why not buy a poster of a <a href="/Celebrities" class="internal">celebrity</a> using our product then sit and gaze slack-jawed in admiration of them? Wishing your purchase accorded you the same status the divvy photoshopped monolith you stare at drool-eyed and goggle-mouthed enjoys...<br />
Look! A fast paced CGI sequence with some sub-scientific cack voiced by a guy you last saw sticking a off-camera finger into the low slung jeans of some perma-tanned tart on a beach on afternoon <a href="/Television" class="internal">TV</a>! Impressed? You wibble be!<br />
<a href="/TheRestlessCorporation" class="internal">TheRestlessCorporation</a> is committed to the betterment of the situationisation of the environmental globitude. <a href="/ClimateChange" class="broken internal">ClimateChange</a> is a concern to us, this is why were are already building a huge penis shaped spaceship out of gold and African babies&#39; teeth to fly us to safety when <a href="/London" class="broken internal">London</a> finally sinks under its own superheated filth. <br />
We also like <a href="/Gays" class="internal">gays</a> and <a href="/Ethnics" class="broken internal">ethnics</a>. As long as they aren&#39;t <a href="/PoorPeople" class="broken internal">poor</a>. Look! There&#39;s a demographically accurate number of members of the aformentioned groups in our promotional literature. Not so many that they&#39;d bother you if you didn&#39;t want to see them though! (seriously if it&#39;s a problem we know a <a href="/GeorgeWBush" class="broken internal">guy</a> who can have them all killed...)<br />
Anyway next time you&#39;re at your wit&#39;s end because you haven&#39;t the imagination to think of anything good for yourself to do and pub conversation has ground to a halt, why not discuss the merits of our product with your friends, who have all also seen this promotion and will agree that this is indeed the product they have all been waiting for. Then you can go out and buy and discuss how it&#39;s good but perhaps not as good as we implied. Make sure you all buy slight variations on the product so as not to appear to all be trying to be the same. And if you&#39;re the first to buy it, you can complain that everyone is copying your idea. As though you&#39;ve ever had an original fucking idea in you worthless life! Haw Haw Haw!<br />
Anyway, buy this/invest in us. Or <a href="/BuyThings" class="internal">buy something else</a>, we own all those too!<hr />Interested in working for <a href="/TheRestlessCorporation" class="internal">TheRestlessCorporation</a>? <a href="/TheRestlessCorporationEmployees" class="internal">click here</a>
