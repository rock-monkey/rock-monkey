    <h2>LiberalDemocrats</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    Party that may, one day, someday, be in government.<br />
Like: Yellow, Freedom, Fairness, Trust.<br />
Dislike: War, <a href="/CouncilTax" class="internal">CouncilTax</a>, <a href="/TuitionFees" class="internal">TuitionFees</a>, Alcohol (ahem...)<br />
<a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a> will be voting Lib Dem until a more <a href="/Socialist" class="broken internal">Socialist</a> party comes along which is viable, it may be some time<br />
<a href="http://www.libdemthistime.org" class="broken external">Brian Eno likes them</a><br />
<a href="/GarethBowker" class="internal">GarethBowker</a> has decided to change his voting allegience to the <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a> having previously always voted <a href="/PlaidCymru" class="internal">PlaidCymru</a>. He also wonders what would happen if everyone who thought &quot;yeah, I support the Lib Dems, but they&#39;ll never get in, so I&#39;ll vote for another party instead&quot; voted Lib Dem. (<a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/poster/0,9573,462993,00.html" class="broken external">This would, according to the Lib Dems</a> - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)<br />
<a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>, a long-running ballot-spoiler (on the grounds that the democracy in the <a href="/UnitedKingdom" class="internal">UK</a> is a farce that needs a complete overhaul) has also recently changed allegience to the <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a>, because their policies are actually worth voting for: the system can change another day.<br />
<a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> is a member of the <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a> and will be voting for them because they appear to be a party willing to do things for other people, and not themselves. Which, frankly, is a fucking miracle these days.<br />
<a href="/KtErrington" class="internal">KtErrington</a> will also be voting Liberal Democrat because Labour can&#39;t viably be called left-wing any more. The Liberal Democrats would, if elected, increase taxation for the highest earners in Britain, actually ensure Britain meets it&#39;s targets under the Kyoto Protocol, start making friends with the UN and (I quote) &quot;forge a new relationship with the United States which is a partnership of influence, and not so subordinate as to appear subservient&quot;. <br />
Another Labour term and we&#39;ll be up to our eyeballs with &#39;the right to chose your children&#39;s privately funded school&#39;, none of which will be up to standard, some of which will probably specialise in nailcare and nothing else (and be given a grants for reaching their national targets in nailcare) and all of which will reflect the selling out of public services which should be an automatic right for everyone. I don&#39;t want the right to chose, I want every single school and hospital to be of a great standard, so that I don&#39;t have to shop around like someone searching for a Marathon bar and finding only Snickers. It&#39;s a right-wing policy for a right-wing government, and I think they&#39;ve had their day.<br />
<a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonAtkinson</a> wonders why people believe anything any party says. They&#39;re all liars, end of story. For fucks sake, don&#39;t vote on what is promised, vote on the economic issues, they&#39;re really all that matter.<br />
<a href="/MattInTheHat" class="internal">MattInTheHat</a> likes their national policies but due to the way the political system of the <a href="/UnitedKingdom" class="internal">UK</a> works he will need to contact his local representative and find out their personal views and in what way (if any) they differ from their party&#39;s. This is less of an issue than it is in America due to the tighter cohesion within the political parties in the UK as compared to the US (e.g. during <a href="/GeorgeWBush" class="broken internal">GeorgeWBush</a>&#39;s presidential election campaign he said that he had not read the Republican Party Platform {basically a manifesto}: can you imagine any politician in the UK saying that?). Also less of an issue since <a href="/MattInTheHat" class="internal">MattInTheHat</a> doesn&#39;t have a (legal) vote in the US elections. See also <a href="/MattInTheHatsViewsOnTheParties" class="internal">MattInTheHatsViewsOnTheParties</a><br />
<a href="/ClaireMelton" class="internal">ClaireMelton</a> is a member of the Liberal Democrats and will be voting for them. The mere fact that they&#39;ve not been in power in my lifetime means their policies are about what makes sense, rather than what will win votes, as they are resigned to the fact that they&#39;ll never win. If they do get in they&#39;ll eventually become as corrupt as the two major parties, but for a while it will be great.<br />
<a href="/MattPayne" class="internal">MattPayne</a> is currently an undecided voter in Aberystwyth, having registered to vote here with the intention of originally voting for the <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a>.  From where he comes from he would vote for them without hesitation.  But then his home seat of <a href="/BirminghamEdgbaston" class="internal">BirminghamEdgbaston</a>, was a safe Conservative seat until 1997 and is reasonably safe Labour seat, the <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a> always come a very poor third.  He refuses to vote for Vanitas/Veritas, who are also standing in Ceredigion, he dislikes the Conservatives on the large majority of policy issues and Labour do not stand a chance in Ceredigion and <a href="/MattPayne" class="internal">MattPayne</a> distrusts them and their policies.  He has no qualms about the <a href="/PlaidCymru" class="internal">PlaidCymru</a> candidate Simon Thomas who has done a decent job and thinks <a href="/PlaidCymru" class="internal">PlaidCymru</a> do actually stick up for Wales whereas the other parties get swamped by London.  He may toss a coin to decide but any reasonable debate anywhere will be helpful.<br />
Update: The <a href="/LiberalDemocrats" class="internal">LiberalDemocrats</a> won the constituency of Ceredigion taking it away from <a href="/PlaidCymru" class="internal">PlaidCymru</a> with only a 219 vote majority.  Therefore if all those on this page voted <a href="/LiberalDemocrat" class="internal">LiberalDemocrat</a> and voted in Ceredigion that would make up nearly 5% of their majority.<hr />Page about <a href="/Politics" class="internal">Politics</a>
