AlecR will be voting Lib Dem until a more [[Socialist]] party comes along which is viable, it may be some time

[[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.libdemthistime.org Brian Eno likes them]]

GarethBowker has decided to change his voting allegience to the LiberalDemocrats having previously always voted PlaidCymru. He also wonders what would happen if everyone who thought &quot;yeah, I support the Lib Dems, but they&#x27;ll never get in, so I&#x27;ll vote for another party instead&quot; voted Lib Dem. ([[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;politics.guardian.co.uk&#x2F;election2001&#x2F;poster&#x2F;0,9573,462993,00.html This would, according to the Lib Dems]] - [[DanHuntley Dan]])

DanHuntley, a long-running ballot-spoiler (on the grounds that the democracy in the [[UnitedKingdom UK]] is a farce that needs a complete overhaul) has also recently changed allegience to the LiberalDemocrats, because their policies are actually worth voting for: the system can change another day.

MisterJTA is a member of the LiberalDemocrats and will be voting for them because they appear to be a party willing to do things for other people, and not themselves. Which, frankly, is a fucking miracle these days.

KtErrington will also be voting Liberal Democrat because Labour can&#x27;t viably be called left-wing any more. The Liberal Democrats would, if elected, increase taxation for the highest earners in Britain, actually ensure Britain meets it&#x27;s targets under the Kyoto Protocol, start making friends with the UN and (I quote) &quot;forge a new relationship with the United States which is a partnership of influence, and not so subordinate as to appear subservient&quot;. 
Another Labour term and we&#x27;ll be up to our eyeballs with &#x27;the right to chose your children&#x27;s privately funded school&#x27;, none of which will be up to standard, some of which will probably specialise in nailcare and nothing else (and be given a grants for reaching their national targets in nailcare) and all of which will reflect the selling out of public services which should be an automatic right for everyone. I don&#x27;t want the right to chose, I want every single school and hospital to be of a great standard, so that I don&#x27;t have to shop around like someone searching for a Marathon bar and finding only Snickers. It&#x27;s a right-wing policy for a right-wing government, and I think they&#x27;ve had their day.

JonAtkinson wonders why people believe anything any party says. They&#x27;re all liars, end of story. For fucks sake, don&#x27;t vote on what is promised, vote on the economic issues, they&#x27;re really all that matter.

MattInTheHat likes their national policies but due to the way the political system of the [[UnitedKingdom UK]] works he will need to contact his local representative and find out their personal views and in what way (if any) they differ from their party&#x27;s. This is less of an issue than it is in America due to the tighter cohesion within the political parties in the UK as compared to the US (e.g. during GeorgeWBush&#x27;s presidential election campaign he said that he had not read the Republican Party Platform {basically a manifesto}: can you imagine any politician in the UK saying that?). Also less of an issue since MattInTheHat doesn&#x27;t have a (legal) vote in the US elections. See also MattInTheHatsViewsOnTheParties

ClaireMelton is a member of the Liberal Democrats and will be voting for them. The mere fact that they&#x27;ve not been in power in my lifetime means their policies are about what makes sense, rather than what will win votes, as they are resigned to the fact that they&#x27;ll never win. If they do get in they&#x27;ll eventually become as corrupt as the two major parties, but for a while it will be great.

MattPayne is currently an undecided voter in Aberystwyth, having registered to vote here with the intention of originally voting for the LiberalDemocrats.  From where he comes from he would vote for them without hesitation.  But then his home seat of BirminghamEdgbaston, was a safe Conservative seat until 1997 and is reasonably safe Labour seat, the LiberalDemocrats always come a very poor third.  He refuses to vote for Vanitas&#x2F;Veritas, who are also standing in Ceredigion, he dislikes the Conservatives on the large majority of policy issues and Labour do not stand a chance in Ceredigion and MattPayne distrusts them and their policies.  He has no qualms about the PlaidCymru candidate Simon Thomas who has done a decent job and thinks PlaidCymru do actually stick up for Wales whereas the other parties get swamped by London.  He may toss a coin to decide but any reasonable debate anywhere will be helpful.

Update: The LiberalDemocrats won the constituency of Ceredigion taking it away from PlaidCymru with only a 219 vote majority.  Therefore if all those on this page voted LiberalDemocrat and voted in Ceredigion that would make up nearly 5% of their majority.
