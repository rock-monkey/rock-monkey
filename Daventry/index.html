      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">[[Daventry]] is a fictional town inhabited by StrokeyAdam, StrokeyEmma and lots of GuineaPigs. 

It is home to the largest PaperClip factory in the WesternHemisphere, where the paperclips are bent into shape by GuineaPigs. One naughty [[GuineaPigs GuineaPig]] called Jim, went through a phase of making swearwords out of the paperclip wire. He was not dismissed but rather became the guru of those ChineseGuysInTheStreetMakingYourNameOutOfWire, who travel from the FarEast to study under him before going out into the world. 

SwearWords and PaperClips are [[Daventry Daventry&#x27;s]] two primary exports. The word QuimNinja was the most recent swearword to be created in [[Daventry]], it was not as succesful as previous efforts such as KnobJockey, TwatGoblin and FuckBadger.

It is also home to the famous DaventryMooCowOrchestra.

It was the fourth in a series of 26 planned towns built by the late Dave Entry. The first two [[Aventry]] and [[Baventry]], blew away in a high wind one spring morning. The third, [[Coventry]] is still standing and was awarded non-fictitious status by Sir MargaretThatcher in 1985. The series only got as far as [[Eventry]], but no one has ever been there as Dave won&#x27;t tell anyone where it is.

It is twinned with the [[French]] town of [[Deriere]].

Famous people born in Daventry include MartinBashir and KermitTheFrog.
----
Also the name of a fictional [[SexualPositions SexualPosition]].
