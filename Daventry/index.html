    <a href="/Daventry" class="internal">Daventry</a> is a fictional town inhabited by <a href="/StrokeyAdam" class="internal">StrokeyAdam</a>, <a href="/StrokeyEmma" class="broken internal">StrokeyEmma</a> and lots of <a href="/GuineaPigs" class="internal">GuineaPigs</a>. <br />
It is home to the largest <a href="/PaperClip" class="internal">PaperClip</a> factory in the <a href="/WesternHemisphere" class="broken internal">WesternHemisphere</a>, where the paperclips are bent into shape by <a href="/GuineaPigs" class="internal">GuineaPigs</a>. One naughty <a href="/GuineaPigs" class="internal">GuineaPig</a> called Jim, went through a phase of making swearwords out of the paperclip wire. He was not dismissed but rather became the guru of those <a href="/ChineseGuysInTheStreetMakingYourNameOutOfWire" class="broken internal">ChineseGuysInTheStreetMakingYourNameOutOfWire</a>, who travel from the <a href="/FarEast" class="broken internal">FarEast</a> to study under him before going out into the world. <br />
<a href="/SwearWords" class="internal">SwearWords</a> and <a href="/PaperClips" class="internal">PaperClips</a> are <a href="/Daventry" class="internal">Daventry&#39;s</a> two primary exports. The word <a href="/QuimNinja" class="internal">QuimNinja</a> was the most recent swearword to be created in <a href="/Daventry" class="internal">Daventry</a>, it was not as succesful as previous efforts such as <a href="/KnobJockey" class="broken internal">KnobJockey</a>, <a href="/TwatGoblin" class="broken internal">TwatGoblin</a> and <a href="/FuckBadger" class="broken internal">FuckBadger</a>.<br />
It is also home to the famous <a href="/DaventryMooCowOrchestra" class="internal">DaventryMooCowOrchestra</a>.<br />
It was the fourth in a series of 26 planned towns built by the late Dave Entry. The first two <a href="/Aventry" class="broken internal">Aventry</a> and <a href="/Baventry" class="broken internal">Baventry</a>, blew away in a high wind one spring morning. The third, <a href="/Coventry" class="broken internal">Coventry</a> is still standing and was awarded non-fictitious status by Sir <a href="/MargaretThatcher" class="internal">MargaretThatcher</a> in 1985. The series only got as far as <a href="/Eventry" class="broken internal">Eventry</a>, but no one has ever been there as Dave won&#39;t tell anyone where it is.<br />
It is twinned with the <a href="/French" class="broken internal">French</a> town of <a href="/Deriere" class="internal">Deriere</a>.<br />
Famous people born in Daventry include <a href="/MartinBashir" class="broken internal">MartinBashir</a> and <a href="/KermitTheFrog" class="internal">KermitTheFrog</a>.<hr />Also the name of a fictional <a href="/SexualPositions" class="internal">SexualPosition</a>.<br />
