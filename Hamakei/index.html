      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Perched in towers hidden in the desert wastelands, the Hamakei are the last remnants of a past, more sorcerous age. Centuries old, these brittle, withered humanoids have vulture-like heads, and are usually swathed in masses of fine robes. They are warlocks and sages, kept alive well beyond their normal span by arcane spells and magical artefacts. Their powers are wide, gleaned from decades of research in forgotten libraries, but they use them only rarely. The Hamakei see themselves as scholars and observers, and will rarely be drawn into the petty conflicts of mortal men. Their lust is only for knowledge, and their advice can sometimes be traded for an old scroll or ancient device.

As crotchety as an ancient owl, they can be extremely temperamental and absent-minded, but will swiftly turn from doddering fool to wily fox at the mention of lost knowledge. Occasionally a Hamakei will set out into the world of men, wandering from settlement to settlement in search of any snippet it can overhear. Some are interested in the progress of this younger age and will seek out human sorcerers, to see how much of the lost arts they have rediscovered.

If encountered away from its home, a Hamakei will be dressed in inconspicuous travelling-clothes, and will lean on a long staff to help it along. The staff will usually be magical and may have spells bound into it. In the event of a drirect attack, a Hamakei can call upon many spells to ward off attackers, including magical dusts that blind or charm an opponent, and jets and walls of flame and ice. If such attacks fail to repel an aggressor, it will be forced to use its staff to defend itself as best it can.

Their towers will usually be defended by a host of magical traps, to keep intruders away. Their treasure-hoards will be large, consisting for the most part of hundreds of unintelligible and very, very ancient books, scrolls and papers, with a few strange artefacts scattered among them. Any sage worth his salt would pay dearly for even a glimpse of such treasures, though they may appear all but worthless to an adventurer.
