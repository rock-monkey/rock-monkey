Also the name of a moderately attractive woman who appeared on [[Gladiators]], and the went on to be a Television X presenter in the mid 1990&#x27;s. She also breifly appeared on Sky One&#x27;s Gamesworld around 1994-1995 as &#x27;The Games Mistress&#x27;.

RestlessBoy - that song was okay. but it was also &#x27;lust for life&#x27; by IggyPop. and it was utterly derivative and the world is not a better place for it existing and it is therefore [[worthless worthless]].
