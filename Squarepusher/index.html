    <h2>Squarepusher</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    Artist name of Tom Jenkinson (also known as <a href="/ChaosAD" class="internal">ChaosAD</a>). Makes insane jazz/drum n bass <a href="/Electronica" class="auto-fixed internal">electronica</a> for <a href="/WarpRecords" class="internal">WarpRecords</a>. Has made many individual tracks that are utterly stunning in their inventiveness but has also released a whole bunch of crap as well.<br />
His best album is &#39;Big Loada&#39; but his best songs &#39;(Do you know) Squarepusher&#39; and &#39;My Red Hot Car&#39; are to be found elsewhere.<br />
On no account listen to &#39;Music is rotted one note&#39; as it sounds like three different jazz bands falling down three different sets of spiral stairs and trying to carry on playing, yet all playing different songs - only crap.<br />
