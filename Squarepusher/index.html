      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Artist name of Tom Jenkinson (also known as ChaosAD). Makes insane jazz&#x2F;drum n bass [[electronica]] for WarpRecords. Has made many individual tracks that are utterly stunning in their inventiveness but has also released a whole bunch of crap as well.

His best album is &#x27;Big Loada&#x27; but his best songs &#x27;(Do you know) Squarepusher&#x27; and &#x27;My Red Hot Car&#x27; are to be found elsewhere.

On no account listen to &#x27;Music is rotted one note&#x27; as it sounds like three different jazz bands falling down three different sets of spiral stairs and trying to carry on playing, yet all playing different songs - only crap.
