      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Analogue vs Digital. The final say.

====Why analogue is better====
It has a technically infinite dynamic range, meaning all the subtle nuances of the original performance aren&#x27;t lost like they are on digital, which has to &quot;cap&quot; the range at some point (It could be very high, but it&#x27;s still defined). This is why it sounds &quot;warmer&quot;

It&#x27;s closer to real life, being an imitation rather than an interpretation -- and in two hundred years we&#x27;ll have much better chance of being able to play back our analogue records than our CDs and DAT tapes. This is because there are many many different ways of storing things digitally (though thankfully we tend to stick to uncompressed PulseCodeModulation, so all we need is the specification and machinery to read it)

====Why digital is better (assuming PCM)====
Due to only having two signal levels, noise has practically no effect on a digital signal, meaning it can be both stored and transmitted with very little in the way of distortion (noise, attenuation etc...)

Specifications allow for error correction, so if bits of information are missing, you can tell, and request it to be sent again. Unless you can&#x27;t get it again, then you&#x27;re screwed. Incidentally, Mode 2 CDs (eg audio CDs) have really lousy error correction. It is possible to screw up the transmission and still have a playable source

Digital signals can be compressed (even losslessly) thereby saving space, both in bandwidth and storage requirements. Unfortunately we seem to be favouring lossy compression (like [[MP3]]) and run the risk of losing the original source

So there you go.
