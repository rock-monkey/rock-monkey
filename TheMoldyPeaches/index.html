&#x2F;&#x2F;[[TheMoldyPeaches TheMoldyPeaches]] are a self-proclaimed anti-folk group, consisting of, essentially, Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, with the addition of bassist Steve Mertens, drummer Strictly Beats, and guitarists Jack Dishel and Toby Goodshank. Green and Dawson met at Exile on Main Street Records in Mount Kisco, New York, and began working together afterwards. In the early 1990s, the group was part of the New York City underground scene, partially due to the band&#x27;s strange costumes, reminiscent of The Frogs (Kimmy typically dresses as a rabbit, Adam as Robin Hood - [[KtErrington Kt]]). Touring along with bands such as The Strokes and Tenacious D, The Moldy Peaches have released two albums with Sanctuary Records.&#x2F;&#x2F;

My brother has met and hung out with [[TheMoldyPeaches]] while they were performing in Reading supporting The Strokes. Kimmy has extrememly large hair and is very kooky. She also doesn&#x27;t drink [[alcohol]] or do [[Drugs drugs]] since one of her friends died of an overdose a few years ago. This may come as a suprise since much of [[TheMoldyPeaches]]&#x27; strange ramblings appear to be [[Drugs drug]] induced.
Most [[TheMoldyPeaches MoldyPeaches]] songs appear to be deliberately bad and were recorded in a home studio, which makes it all the more suprising when they produce works of genius - [[KtErrington Kt]]
