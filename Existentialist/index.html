    <h2>Existentialist</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    Someone who believes life to be somewhat absurd and that humankind is left alone in the universe to create their own individual morality and purpose, this is a blessing in terms of freedom but a curse in terms of the absolute responsibility with which it endows one. The only real moral rules of existentialism itself are 1 not to decieve yourself and 2 not to hide from others the realisation of their own truth, everything else is left to the individual.<br />
The best overall description of existentialism comes from a small and easily accessible (<a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a> has the attention span of a flea but still managed to.... yadda yadda) book recording a famous lecture given by <a href="/JeanPaulSatre" class="internal">JeanPaulSatre</a> defending his philosophy to the <a href="/Communists" class="internal">Communists</a> called <a href="/Existentialism" class="internal">Existentialism</a> est un humanisme loosely translated as <a href="/Existentialism" class="auto-fixed internal">existentialism</a> and humanism <br />
Quite how <a href="/AlecRichardson" class="internal">AlecRichardson</a> reconciles this with his christianity is somwhat a mystery, even to him, but that&#39;s the beauty of <a href="/Existentialism" class="auto-fixed internal">existentialism</a>. Sooren Kikergaard was probably the first real existentialist (although kikergaard was actually a pseudonym for a bizzare trio of philosophical writers) and &quot;he&quot; was a christian, he chose christianity knowing that it was flawed. Satre sees christianity and existentialism as completely incompatible, one of the birthplaces of existentialism is in <a href="/FriedrichNietzsche" class="internal">FriedrichNietzsche</a>&#39;s statement &quot;God is Dead&quot;.
