Connect to a channel
Talk

Aww... so sad... &#x2F;&#x2F;(that&#x27;s not in the RFC; it&#x27;s server-specific, and it&#x27;s quite possible within the spec for a channel to exist with no clients, and some IRC servers support stay-open channels - Dan)&#x2F;&#x2F;

Bots you might come into contact with include:

	2) ChanServ
	3) NickServ
	4) MemoServ</script>
