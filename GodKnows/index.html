    It&#39;s always left up in the air, when people say &quot;God knows,&quot; what it is exactly that <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> knows.<br />
Of those people who say &quot;<a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> knows&quot; who actually do believe in the existence of a <a href="/God" class="auto-fixed internal">god</a>, a large majority of them, when questioned, would answer that they believe in a <a href="/God" class="auto-fixed internal">god</a> that knows everything.<br />
However, a vast majority of these would also argue that they believe in <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a>. Therein lies the conflict. A god that exists within the confines of this <a href="/TheUniverse" class="internal">Universe</a> who knows everything, even the future, defies the possibility of <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a> of any other entity in the universe - after all: in a deterministic scenario such as this one, there is no <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a>. Conversely, if that god exists outside of the universe as we can percieve it - and thereby, outside of the confines of Time - we are instead presented with a different paradox; that such a god is not, contrary to the claims of many theists, &#39;perfect&#39;.<br />
<em>Could you please elaborate on why <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a>&#39;s existence outside of <a href="/TheUniverse" class="internal">TheUniverse</a> would preclude perfection?//<br />
</em>Ah, but knowing the possibilities does not preclude the possibilities being chosen. To choose a nearly-accurate example I know what results can occur from a fair six-sided die but that doesn&#39;t mean I know what number will come up the next time it&#39;s thrown. So to extend the analogy for <a href="/TheHardOfThinking" class="broken internal">TheHardOfThinking</a> <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> can know what possibilities there are, and the subsequent consequences, and yet an <a href="/Individual" class="auto-fixed internal">individual</a> still has <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a> to choose from the limited possibilities.<em><br />
</em>Also the argument is flawed in the assertion that <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> exists within this <a href="/TheUniverse" class="internal">Universe</a>. In the dominant world religions the various deities are set apart from <a href="/TheUniverse" class="internal">TheUniverse</a>, either by predating it or transcending it. In such a situation we can only conject upon what possibilities exist with no method of varification.//<br />
&#39;&#39;The word &#39;universe&#39; - as I used it - does not mean - as you used it, &quot;the physical world&quot;. However, I go on later to debate the theory of the existance of a god outside of the confines of a universe as we know it, and eventually conclude that such a god is unprovable in the extreme: a thing for which no evidence can ever exist, by simple definition of &#39;existance&#39; being &#39;that which is, was, or will be in the universe&#39;.&#39;&#39;<br />
<em>&#39;&#39;Apologies. When I used &quot;physical world&quot; it was because most religions were formulated in an age of general cosmic ignorance i.e. they were predominantly concerned with this physical world. I wasn&#39;t wanting to put words into the mouths of religions. Bad Juju lies down that path. Feel free to delete this.&#39;&#39;</em> &#39;&#39;Nah; I like it.&#39;&#39;<br />
<strong>The argument would only be flawed if that was the only scenario I&#39;d considered. Go back and read it more carefully - both boolean options are looked into. While you can state that a die will land on one of six sides, you cannot state which will occur, I concur... but an entity that knew _everything_ would. Which means that - as far as they were concerned - it makes no difference.</strong><br />
<em><strong>&quot;While you ... cannot state which will occur ... and entity that knew _everything_ would.&quot; This is confusing: you seem to say &quot;I agree with you but I&#39;m still right&quot;. You concur that the entity would not have certain knowledge of the outcome of an event but would know all possible sequences of events throughout <a href="/Eternity" class="broken internal">Eternity</a> (if such a thing exists). This then means that <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> can predict all possible futures but not one certain one. Hence, whilst <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> knows all futures <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> doesn&#39;t know the future. It would make no difference to <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a>&#39;s knowledge (as omniscient, nothing could) except that <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a> would then know what has occurred.</strong></em><br />
The idea of a &#39;perfect&#39; <a href="/God" class="internal">God</a>, as depicted by most theists, is in contradiction to that of a <a href="/TheUniverse" class="internal">Universe</a> in which <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a> is possible. Perfection implies determinism, because determinism is the absolute absence of chaos, and chaos defies perfection.<br />
<em>The statement that &#39;chaos defies perfection&#39; is subjective. Many people see beauty in cloud formations, shore lines and erosion patterns and whilst those phenomena are based upon physical systems the number of variables is so huge that the human mind reduces it to &#39;chaos&#39;. If self-determinism exists it still limits the number of variables (whilst I can choose whether or not to stand up from my seat I cannot choose to fly).</em><br />
<strong>The beauty in cloud formations comes from the brain identifying with patterns within the chaos. I wasn&#39;t referring to self-determinism, I was talking about pure, literal, metaphysical determinism - i.e. is there any randomness in the universe? In a universe with any randomness, determinism counters <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a>; if there is not, the mere question of <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a> is, in itself, irrelevant.</strong><br />
<em><strong>You have yet to justify &#39;chaos defies perfection&#39;.</strong>//<br />
</em><strong>Saying that determinism counters <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a> is a lovely bit of factorising that tidies things up marvellously, but both have yet to be proven or agreed upon, let alone be shown to counter each other. Is it not possible that <a href="/FreeWill" class="internal">FreeWill</a>, determinism and randomness are not absolutes and that they combine to affect the outcome of events?</strong>//<br />
<strong>On the other hand, I personally believe in a truly deterministic universe. Therefore, there is space within my model of the universe for a &#39;perfect&#39; God. Perhaps I just find it difficult to concieve of a &#39;perfect&#39; God within the scope of the popular image of an &#39;imperfect&#39; universe, and can&#39;t look past the argument that says that it is possible to be certain of the existance of &#39;one&#39; and &#39;only&#39; god when that god can&#39;t be (even theoretically) demonstrated to exist outside of time. The fact that, in my model, I choose not to believe in such a god, is also entirely pre-determined. How queer.</strong><hr />Where philosophy meets phraseology.<hr /><a href="/CategoryReligiousArguments" class="internal">CategoryReligiousArguments</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">No you can't without permission matt plus the fact is the counter argument is in fact relevant to the whole debate.
