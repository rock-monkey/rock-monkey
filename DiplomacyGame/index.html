      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Diplomacy is a [[CategoryBoardGames board game]] which features no luck, and seven players. Each player represents one of the seven Great Powers present in Europe prior to the Great War. 

The players attempt to win the game by controlling 18 or more of the supply depots on the map at the end of their turn. This cannot be achieved without the help of other players. Nor can it be achieved without stabbing other players in the back. 

How clever is that?!

The trick, apparently, is knowing when to make a deal, and when to break it. And knowing whom you may trust, of course. Currently, an online version is being played out amongst several of the GeekNight regulars. Bearing in mind the trick (see above) it&#x27;s likely to be a fairly interesting mix of trust, betrayal and blind, indignant fury.
