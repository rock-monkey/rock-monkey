Violent, stupid and thus very dangerous, **Cave Trolls** are the most primitive of all Troll races. They tend to be leaner than other Trolls, their bodies lithe and muscular with long arms that end in sharpened claws. They are uglier, if that is possible, than Common Trolls, and their teeth are far larger, sticking out more like tusks from their drooling mouths. They are solitary, unsociable creatures, usually found hiding from daylight in a dark cave or passage deep underground. They are exclusively carnivorous and delight in the tender flesh of [[human humans]], but more often have to settle for stringy rat meat. Their favourite weapons are clubs and long knives, though their talons are just as effective. They hoard shiny items, attracted by their glitter, and their lairs may be crammed with all manner of glinting things, some valuable

Once living in the wilderness like [[Orcs]], **Common Trolls** are mostly found in the armies of evil, where they can practise their favourite hobbies against puny humans. There are still a few primitive tribes of Common Trolls living in rough villages in the wildlands, but even they are considerably more civilized (as Trolls go) than the average Hill or Cave Troll. If a more primitive Common Troll is encountered, it will fortunately be less skillful in battle, for it will not have had the benefit of military training. Whatever their circumstances, Common Trolls are usually large and fat, taller than a [[human]] by about a head, with ugly faces and muscular limbs. They are gruff and surly creatures, but they enjoy jokes in which other beings get severely injured. Their favourite weapons are large battle-axes and war-hammers

The interminable wars between the [[Dwarfs]] and the **Hill Trolls** have continued since before history was recorded, for the two races loathe each other. Hill Trolls are warlike beings, who provide endless hazards to travellers and settlers in the higher regions. They are the largest of all Trolls, usually dressed in furs and leathers, their long hair braided with bones and jewellery. Their favourite weapons are spears and battle-axes, and they also use shields and odd scraps of armour to protect themselves. They dwell in tribal villages high in the hills, from where they can sweep down into the valleys to attack the settlements of [[Dwarfs]] and [[human humans]] alike. They don&#x27;t like goats much either

**Sea Trolls** dwell in large bodies of water, from deep oceans to inland lakes. They have scaly green skins, webbed hands and feet, and gills in their necks, but otherwise look much like Cave Trolls. They live on fish, but occasionally manage to overturn a boat or pluck a tasty [[human]] from a riverbank. They can only survive in air for a few minutes, but that is usually enough for them to grab someone with their claws, bite depply into his neck, and leap back in to the water with him. They are hated by Merfolk, who will try to kill the things if they stray too near to their territory. Sea Trolls make their lairs in underwater caves, often hiding them with weed for protection. Inside there may be many relics of their past victims, both bones and treasure.
