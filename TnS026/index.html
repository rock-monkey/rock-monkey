    <h1>Western Gate</h1>&quot;You don&#39;t <em>sound</em> very happy.&quot; You tell the guard. Your super-honed squirrel senses are telling you that all is not as it seems here.<br />
The guard turns, very slowly. His face is still fixed in the ridiculous grin. He looks you over.<br />
&quot;The Queen must be getting pretty desperate if she has to send rodents to do her dirty work.&quot;<br />
The tone is mocking, but he&#39;s still grinning as if his life depended on it.<hr />What now?<br />
<a href="/TnS006" class="internal">Get out of there!</a><br />
Talk:<br />
<a href="/TnS027" class="internal">&#39;I&#39;ll rodent you, you lump of lard! And your helmet doesn&#39;t fit!&#39;</a><br />
<a href="/TnS028" class="internal">&#39;What queen? What are you talking about?&#39;</a><br />
<a href="/TnS029" class="internal">&#39;I&#39;m on your side. I hate the Queen, and have come to free the elves from her reign of terror!&#39;</a>
