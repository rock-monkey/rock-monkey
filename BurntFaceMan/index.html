    A cartoon by <a href="/DavidFirth" class="internal">DavidFirth</a> about man called Stanley Sage who was injured in a welding accident at the age of 3 and as a result decided to take up fighting crime. He faces supervillians such as Welding Man, Craig the Toilet, Paperwork Dan (the paperwork man), Man-spider and Bastard Man. His sidekick is called Suggestion Boy. His superpowers appear to be flight, creating sonic booms to blast away villains and the ability to play guitar solos. He&#39;s not <a href="/Homosexual" class="internal">gay</a>. Crackin stuff. Watch the trailer for his non existent movie <a href="http://www.fat-pie.com/bfmtrailer.htm" class="broken external">here.</a>
