    The fearsome black-and-red <a href="/SearchEngine" class="internal">SearchEngine</a> was one of the principal characters in Thomas the Tank Engine: The Sodor Massacres, a series written by a channel 5 development team which tragically never saw daylight.<br />
In it, an army of evil trains led by <a href="/SearchEngine" class="internal">SearchEngine</a> took over the island, forcing Thomas and the other survivors to live underground, with only a troop of semi-naked, nymphomanic <a href="/Lesbians" class="internal">Lesbians</a> to bring them the supplies they needed.<br />
<a href="/SearchEngine" class="internal">SearchEngine</a> himself had a laser-guided flamethrower on his back, along with razor-sharp cutting blades extending, Boadiccea style, from his wheels.<br />
The series was pulled in the end so that 5 could make the more crowd-pleasing Sister Act III: The <a href="/Lesbian" class="internal">Lesbian</a> Years, and the <a href="/SearchEngine" class="internal">SearchEngine</a> action figures, of which none were ever made, are now highly collectible.<hr />&#39;&#39;This is a <a href="/TotalBollocks" class="internal">TotalBollocks</a> page. As if you hadn&#39;t guessed...&#39;&#39;
