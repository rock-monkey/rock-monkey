    How should block 5 be referred to as without lying too much to make it seem nice and pleasant<br />
Good features;<br />
-There are worse blocks.<hr />See <a href="/PenbrynBlock7" class="internal">PenbrynBlock7</a><br />
-<a href="/PenbrynBlock9" class="internal">PenbrynBlock9</a><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">AnonaMouse - either register a proper name or post without logging in.<br />
Unless good reason give the AnonaMouse account will be deleted by the end of the day.</div><cite><a href="/AndyKeohane">AndyKeohane</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Why? Why do you have to know who someone is? Why can't someone be anonymous if they want to and still enjoy all the benefits of registration? What if they used a pseudonym that was plausible (like Andrew Young)? Would you still delete them?</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I would. But it's not my server.<br />
<br />
And I'd certainly ditch AnonaMouse because they were a vandal. =o)</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">You can post as a non registered user, but if you register your id must be known to at least me or at least two other registered users.</div><cite><a href="/AndyKeohane">AndyKeohane</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Non-registered. Two 'at leasts' is technically possible but poor writing and the comma is a couple of words too early.<br />
<br />
Doesn't limiting registration to people we know severley limit the number of possible users? I realise that when two people I know join then someone that they both knows can join and the someone else and so on but that would lead to a very small growth rate. Since this is the case why don't we just have an invitation system?</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Wasn't actually thinking much when I wrote that. Anyone can register my problem was that someone registered just, it seems, to vandalise the site. You are of course welcome, if not encouraged, to invite people to register but vandalism to the site will not be tolerated.</div><cite><a href="/AndyKeohane">AndyKeohane</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Yeah, spoke to Dan earlier today who told me that that was what was going on. Of course you can't tolerate vandalism, I just read your comments to mean that no-one could have an anonymous account. Understand now.</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote></div>
