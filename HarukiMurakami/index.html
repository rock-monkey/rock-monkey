      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">HarukiMurakami is a Japanese author of the post-war baby-boom generation. 

His style is, I suppose, mundane poetry. Most of his works shares the common themes of vice, death, growing up and beauty in unexpected places. 

**List of works (or at least the ones JonAtkinson owns) with short descriptions:**

~-TheWindupBirdChronicle - I very twisty novel that starts with Noboru Wataya (a cat) going missing, and ends with the Japanese massacres in Manchuria in WorldWarII. I think it&#x27;s overrated.

~-TheElephantVanishes - A collection of short stories. Most don&#x27;t cover much time, so they&#x27;re a little like looking at paintings, or polaroid photos. Interesting, because some of his characters from other books started from these short stories.

~-AWildSheepChase - An unnamed protaganist starts to recieve strange letters from his friend, TheRat, and is contacted by a shadowy media organisation to track down a particular sheep from a particular photograph. Along the way, he stays at the DolphinHotel, meets TheSheepMan, and loses his girlfriend.

~-DanceDanceDance - The sequel to AWildSheepChase sees the anonymous anti-hero recovering from the events of the previous book. He decided to put the past to rest, and try to find his lost girlfirend  by returning to the DolphinHotel. However, much has changed, and along the way he meets a depressed movie star, a beautiful 13 year old girl, and a man with one arm. This book also has the only &#x27;cameo&#x27; role the author has ever written, appearing as himself under than name HakamiMakiumura.

~-SputnikSweetheart - I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this one. It has all the right ingredients (inreachable girl, unremarkable protagonist, greek island), but something didn&#x27;t quite sit correctly with me. The story of Mui was very enjoyable, but I felt the ending brought in a new relationship too late in the novel. One for the hardcore, but the conclusion leaves you a little empty.

~-AfterTheQuake - A collection of short stories all connected with the Kobe earthquake.

~-NorwegianWood - A story about a student who falls in love while at university. When his lover vanishes, he sets off to find her in an asylum, and learns of her roomates past.

~-BirthdayStories - Yes, yes, yes so good. I read this entirely in a couple of hours, and I&#x27;m still reeling a few weeks later. It&#x27;s an anthology, which has short stories revolving around the theme of birthdays, ageing and the passage of time from (among others) PaulTheroux, DenisJohnson, RaymondCarver and RusselBanks. Murakami adds his own story too. I think the best story was probably &#x27;The Birthday Cake&#x27;, by DanielLyons.

~-Hard-boilder Wonderland and the End of the World - Got this from [[HayleyDrew]] for Valentines day. Not read it yet.

~-South of the Border, West of the Sun - As above.

There are more books, but I&#x27;ll add them as I read them.

**His other works (that SianThomas has read)**

~-Underground - Non-fiction work about the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo underground by members of the Aum cult in which twelve people died and thousands were injured. This book contains interviews with the survivors. Fascinating look at the impact of the event on ordinary people and scary how many people just carried on working while suffering from sarin exposure.

~-KafkaOnTheShore - His latest novel to be published here. Oedipal prophecies, talking cats, Hegel-quoting prostitues, ColonelSanders as a pimp, JohnnieWalker as a kitty killer, fish rainstorms. A bit hard to describe in other words (as with most Murakami) but it&#x27;s fab.

~- [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.murakami.ch&#x2F;main_2.html Murakami.ch]] also has some good articles. I recommend [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.murakami.ch&#x2F;about_hm&#x2F;articles&#x2F;articles_confessions_junkie_sonam_the_hindu.html Confessions Of A Murakami Junkie]]; it describes almost exactly how I feel about Murakami.
