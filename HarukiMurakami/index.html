  <section>
    <a href="/HarukiMurakami" class="internal">HarukiMurakami</a> is a Japanese author of the post-war baby-boom generation. <br />
His style is, I suppose, mundane poetry. Most of his works shares the common themes of vice, death, growing up and beauty in unexpected places. <br />
<strong>List of works (or at least the ones <a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonAtkinson</a> owns) with short descriptions:</strong><ul></li><li><a href="/TheWindupBirdChronicle" class="internal">TheWindupBirdChronicle</a> - I very twisty novel that starts with Noboru Wataya (a cat) going missing, and ends with the Japanese massacres in Manchuria in <a href="/WorldWarII" class="internal">WorldWarII</a>. I think it&#39;s overrated.</li><li><a href="/TheElephantVanishes" class="broken internal">TheElephantVanishes</a> - A collection of short stories. Most don&#39;t cover much time, so they&#39;re a little like looking at paintings, or polaroid photos. Interesting, because some of his characters from other books started from these short stories.</li><li>A<a href="/WildSheepChase" class="broken internal">WildSheepChase</a> - An unnamed protaganist starts to recieve strange letters from his friend, <a href="/TheRat" class="broken internal">TheRat</a>, and is contacted by a shadowy media organisation to track down a particular sheep from a particular photograph. Along the way, he stays at the <a href="/DolphinHotel" class="broken internal">DolphinHotel</a>, meets <a href="/TheSheepMan" class="internal">TheSheepMan</a>, and loses his girlfriend.</li><li><a href="/DanceDanceDance" class="broken internal">DanceDanceDance</a> - The sequel to A<a href="/WildSheepChase" class="broken internal">WildSheepChase</a> sees the anonymous anti-hero recovering from the events of the previous book. He decided to put the past to rest, and try to find his lost girlfirend  by returning to the <a href="/DolphinHotel" class="broken internal">DolphinHotel</a>. However, much has changed, and along the way he meets a depressed movie star, a beautiful 13 year old girl, and a man with one arm. This book also has the only &#39;cameo&#39; role the author has ever written, appearing as himself under than name <a href="/HakamiMakiumura" class="broken internal">HakamiMakiumura</a>.</li><li><a href="/SputnikSweetheart" class="broken internal">SputnikSweetheart</a> - I wasn&#39;t too sure about this one. It has all the right ingredients (inreachable girl, unremarkable protagonist, greek island), but something didn&#39;t quite sit correctly with me. The story of Mui was very enjoyable, but I felt the ending brought in a new relationship too late in the novel. One for the hardcore, but the conclusion leaves you a little empty.</li><li><a href="/AfterTheQuake" class="internal">AfterTheQuake</a> - A collection of short stories all connected with the Kobe earthquake.</li><li><a href="/NorwegianWood" class="broken internal">NorwegianWood</a> - A story about a student who falls in love while at university. When his lover vanishes, he sets off to find her in an asylum, and learns of her roomates past.</li><li><a href="/BirthdayStories" class="broken internal">BirthdayStories</a> - Yes, yes, yes so good. I read this entirely in a couple of hours, and I&#39;m still reeling a few weeks later. It&#39;s an anthology, which has short stories revolving around the theme of birthdays, ageing and the passage of time from (among others) <a href="/PaulTheroux" class="broken internal">PaulTheroux</a>, <a href="/DenisJohnson" class="broken internal">DenisJohnson</a>, <a href="/RaymondCarver" class="broken internal">RaymondCarver</a> and <a href="/RusselBanks" class="broken internal">RusselBanks</a>. Murakami adds his own story too. I think the best story was probably &#39;The Birthday Cake&#39;, by <a href="/DanielLyons" class="broken internal">DanielLyons</a>.</li><li>Hard-boilder Wonderland and the End of the World - Got this from <a href="/HayleyDrew" class="internal">HayleyDrew</a> for Valentines day. Not read it yet.</li><li>South of the Border, West of the Sun - As above.</li></ul>There are more books, but I&#39;ll add them as I read them.<br />
<strong>His other works (that <a href="/SianThomas" class="internal">SianThomas</a> has read)</strong><ul></li><li>Underground - Non-fiction work about the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo underground by members of the Aum cult in which twelve people died and thousands were injured. This book contains interviews with the survivors. Fascinating look at the impact of the event on ordinary people and scary how many people just carried on working while suffering from sarin exposure.</li><li><a href="/KafkaOnTheShore" class="broken internal">KafkaOnTheShore</a> - His latest novel to be published here. Oedipal prophecies, talking cats, Hegel-quoting prostitues, <a href="/ColonelSanders" class="broken internal">ColonelSanders</a> as a pimp, <a href="/JohnnieWalker" class="broken internal">JohnnieWalker</a> as a kitty killer, fish rainstorms. A bit hard to describe in other words (as with most Murakami) but it&#39;s fab.</li></ul><strong>Other Resources:</strong><ul></li><li> Salon.com has an <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/1997/12/cov_si_16int.html" class="broken external">interview</a> with Murakami.</li><li> <a href="http://www.murakami.ch/main_2.html" class="broken external">Murakami.ch</a> also has some good articles. I recommend <a href="http://www.murakami.ch/about_hm/articles/articles_confessions_junkie_sonam_the_hindu.html" class="broken external">Confessions Of A Murakami Junkie</a>; it describes almost exactly how I feel about Murakami.</li><li><a href="http://www.exorcising-ghosts.co.uk" class="broken external">Exorcising Ghosts</a> has lots of links to short stories, reviews, interviews etc.<hr /><a href="/CategoryAuthors" class="internal">Other pages about authors</a></ul>
