This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the moniker TheKLF
---------------
**1. Pure trance originals**

Not to be confused with the &quot;Pure Trance Series&quot;, envisaged as 10 x 2000 limited edition 12&quot; singles, released weekly in September-December 1988. That never happened, although the labels were printed

Anyway, the &quot;pure trance originals&quot; typically refers to the original releases of &quot;What Time is Love?&quot;, &quot;3am Eternal&quot; and &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot;, which are nothing like the later &quot;stadium techno&quot; versions most people are familiar with. They are much slower, and more like ambient stuff. Quite pleasant, but you can see why they weren&#x27;t very popular
---------------
**2. Shag Times**

A kind of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation. Contains mostly JAMs stuff, &quot;Doctorin&#x27; The Tardis&quot; and a couple of remixed KLF tracks. Annoyingly, all the KLF tracks and remixes are listed as (incorrect) BPM readings, instead of the titles. The gits.
---------------
**3. Kylie Said to Jason**

This was going to be the first single off the &quot;White Room&quot; soundtrack (see later). Unfortunately, it bombed, and so the soundtrack was never released. Which is a shame really as this track is excellent. Reminds me of &quot;Domino Dancing&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys, but with better singing
---------------
**4. The White Room (OST)**

When &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot; tanked, this release was cancelled, despite it already being completed. So the studio engineer stole copies and leaked it out, so it&#x27;s quite easy to find. The tracks on this differ quite a lot from the &quot;proper&quot; White Room album. Very pleasant light synth-pop stuff, especially &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot;, the album version of &quot;3am Eternal&quot; (a cut-down version of the &quot;pure trance&quot; mix) and &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;
---------------
**5. The White Room (The film)**

Made using the money they got from TheJAMs and &quot;Doctorin&#x27; The Tardis&quot;, it&#x27;s a 50 minute ambient road movie describing Bill and Jimmy&#x27;s quest to find &quot;The White Room&quot;. Unfortunately it&#x27;s rather dull. Only been shown in public once. Allegedly made because they received letters from someone claiming to be from the Illuminatus. Spot the flaw there. Anyway... they were given a contract which required them to make &quot;an artistic representation of themselves on a journey to a place called THE WHITE ROOM&quot;. So they did. Hence the film. Duh.

Most of the footage shot was out of focus or otherwise unuseable, and they ran out of money to finish it. They decided on the ending of the film (based on a &quot;get out clause&quot; they found on the &quot;real&quot; contract. The plan was to show the film silently, and play the soundtrack live. Unfortunately the film is kind of tedious, and the failure of &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot; didn&#x27;t help. The plan was to have an &quot;inner&quot; film and an &quot;outer&quot; film, with the driving-footage being the inner film, and the &quot;outer&quot; film telling the plot. They couldn&#x27;t find sponsors to finish the film as apparently it was &quot;too weird&quot;. The plot itself isn&#x27;t too well known, but it is believed that it follows the story of the Illuminatus and the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. 

Seems once they because successes through their &quot;Stadium techno&quot; releases, they kind of lost interest in the film. A shame really. In addition, no-one knows what happened to the original film. All that remains is a mostly-silent 42 minutes film, with the soundtrack dubbed on from the official soundtrack in appropriate places (so there are long periods of silence with not much happening). Still intriguing to watch though
---------------
**6. Chill Out**

Recorded live, without edits, in one take, by the KLF only. Every time they made a mistake, they started over.

&#x27;The UK CD has only one track, 45 minutes long. The US CD separates this into 14 tracks, based on the &quot;song&quot; titles and approximate timings printed on the label of the UK LP. It seems that the KLF consider Chill Out to be one continuous piece of music, but had to invent a separation into songs so that song-writing royalties can be paid to those sampled&#x27; (KLF FAQ)
---------------
**7. Live at Trancentral&#x2F;SSL&#x2F;Lost Continent**

The &quot;Stadium techno&quot; releases of &quot;3am Eternal&quot;, &quot;Last Train to Trancentral&quot; and &quot;What Time is Love&quot; most people know the KLF for. Not really live at Trancentral&#x2F;The SSL&#x2F;The Lost Continent, they instead used crowd samples. Natch.
---------------
**8. The White Room (Album)**

The only &quot;real&quot; album the KLF released, and it isn&#x27;t what people were expecting. It still sold millions though. The first half comprises of the &quot;live&quot; versions of their well known tracks (see above), and the second half is much more laid back, with heavily remixed versions from the &quot;White Room&quot; soundtrack (no &quot;Kylie&quot; though), ending with an absolutely *beautiful* version of &quot;Justified and Ancient&quot;

The US version ruined this and edited the first five tracks, eliminating the crowd noise and generally making a mess of it. It jumps and cuts very abruptly. The US edition also has the single mix of &#x27;Last Train To Trancentral&#x27; instead of the mellower UK album version, edits &#x27;No More Tears&#x27; down from 9:24 to 6:42, and adds a little more wind noise at the end of the closing &#x27;Justified and Ancient&#x27;
---------------
**9. America - What Time is Love?**

A remixed and remastered version, since the KLF realised they hadn&#x27;t &quot;Broken America&quot; yet. Seems to appeal to patriotism, using phrases such as &quot;This great land&quot; and chants of &quot;America&quot; throughout. Quite funny to listen to objectively as it makes you realise quite how manipulative it is. Still sold well though

I&#x27;m sure &quot;America - Fuck Yeah!&quot; from TeamAmericaWorldPolice is an indirect parody of this, because the crowd chants are very similar, and they both end with a long list of &quot;great&quot; things, though in this case it&#x27;s the names of cities
---------------
**10. The Rites of Mu**

This took place during the 1991 Summer Solstice. A small group of journalists and reporters were invited to the &quot;Lost Continent of Mu&quot;. &quot;The guests were welcomed from the ferry by Mu passport control officer Drummond in peaked cap and shades, who checked their passports and stamped them with a pyramid blaster stamp. They then allowed themselves to be dressed in yellow ceremonial robes, and led in a chanting procession by a white robed high priest of Mu with Horned God headpiece, over the moors to a bonfire beside a huge wicker man, arms raised with weapons poised, head looking up to the sky. The four angels of Mu, in white dresses, with flower head-bands, rose from the sea, and joined the celebrants. The high priest addressed the crowd in &#x27;a tongue that no longer exists, at least not in this world&#x27;. What did the KLF have in store, or was it the Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu controlling the KLF? As the ceremony reached its climax at midnight on the longest day, it was still light. The priest encouraged the guests to direct their psychic energy towards the wicker man, chanting &#x27;Burn Burn Burn&#x27; and the idol burst into flames! What lay ahead was &#x27;enlightenment ... or madness&#x27;. After the ceremony was over the guests were treated to a huge party. The next day is unrecorded but judging by the statement it involved savouring the undervalued qualities of waiting. However they spent the time, by Sunday 23rd of June, the KLF had transported the guests to the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, where, hooded, they joined them on stage for an accapella rendition of Justified And Ancient as Bill and Jimmy handed out ice creams from an ice-cream van which they had borrowed. The total cost of the weekend was supposed to be around 70,000 ukpounds. But for what?&quot; (KLF FAQ)

Who knows. But the transcription CD makes interesting listening
---------------
**11. Justified and Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)**

Their best known work, partially thanks to a wonderful country singer called TammyWynette (RIP). Quite different from the album version, and includes such things as a rap and a bouncier drum loop. Their last &quot;official&quot; release0
---------------
**12. The KLF with Extreme Noise Terror (BRIT awards)**

&quot;Somehow the KLF persuaded the organisers to let them perform with Extreme Noise Terror, and they began to plan their performance. &quot;The plans kept changing. They varied from me going onstage and literally cutting my age, Manics style into my chest with a knife, to me snogging Jimmy onstage, to Jimmy simulating sex with his girlfriend. Then we were going to cut up a dead sheep on stage and throw blood over the front rows of the audience. The idea was that two thirds of the way through the song this altar would appear with the sheep on... we&#x27;d bought the meat cleavers, the knives, the tablecloth, got everything.&quot; Drummond explains how such ideas come to them: &quot;we don&#x27;t always think things through beforehand...we just do them. Jimmy really had me going, he suggested that I use the cleaver to cut my own hand off!&quot;

On the morning of the show (12th February &#x27;92) Drummond drove to an abattoir in Northampton and bought a whole dead sheep and eight gallons of blood. Rumours began to circulate of the plan, and first the BBC lawyers and then hardcore vegetarians Extreme Noise Terror made it blatantly known that they were totally against the idea.&quot; So the sheep plan was scrapped, and instead *just* the thrash performance, and Bill spraying the audience with blanks from a machine gun took place. There&#x27;s no doubt however that this performance did annoy, shock and disgust many of the &#x27;pigtails in suits&#x27; present in the audience and presumably many of the live TV audience in their living rooms. Trevor Horn (producer of Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Relax&quot;) seemed to be in a state of shock. &quot;They were horrible! Shooting with machine guns! Disgraceful!&quot;. Eminent Hungarian classical composer Sir George Solti tried to leave the auditorium during the performance and had to be persuaded to return to his seat.

As Scott Piering&#x27;s voice announced &quot;The KLF have now left the music business&quot; the two bands hurried off the stage and straight into their van and back to Trancentral. Later in the show The KLF (jointly with Simply Red) were awarded the title Best British Band. Since they had now left the building they sent along sidekick Hector, resplendent in motor cycle messenger gear, to pick up the statuette. Having been told there was no way he was being allowed access, Hector dashed onstage, grabbed the trophy from startled Martika and escaped into the labyrinth of corridors behind the glittering stage. This of course was cut from the TV coverage. Later, he was cornered by security, who wrestled &#x27;the BRIT&#x27; back off him.

The BRIT award statuette was later unearthed in a field near Stonehenge by a local farmer. From Q Magazine: &quot;The yeoperson&#x27;s shovel-wielding presence remains as unexplained as The KLF&#x27;s wish to bury it there in the first place.&quot; Jimmy has been vague when questioned on this.&quot; (KLF FAQ)
---------------
**13. Unreleased singles**

&quot;Deep Shit&quot;
&quot;Love Trance&quot;
&quot;The Lover&#x27;s Side&quot;
&quot;Deep Shit Part 3&quot;
&quot;The White Room (soundtrack)&quot;
&quot;No More Tears&quot;
&quot;Go to Sleep&quot;
&quot;Madrugada Eterna&quot;

And hundreds of demos and the like. They weren&#x27;t very good at releasing things, were they?

Oh, and then there&#x27;s
---------------
**14. The Black Room**

&quot;The legendary unreleased LP, the darker, harder twin to the White Room LP. It was referred to in interviews for ages, even before the White Room was released. Originally it was planned to be harder techno (like It&#x27;s Grim Up North), then it was going to be heavy-metal techno (like America - What Time is Love?) and then it was going to be a thrash-metal collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror (like the TOTP version of 3 am Eternal). It&#x27;s unknown, how much of each incarnation was complete, before it was scrapped and recording was re-started.

Jimmy said of it in December &#x27;90: &quot;The &#x27;Black Room&#x27; album will all be this kind of electro turbo metal. It&#x27;s not really industrial like, say, Throbbing Gristle, because it&#x27;s coming from house and has an uplifting vibe about it. But it&#x27;s so heavy it will just pin you to the floor.&quot;; while Drummond said of it in March &#x27;91: &quot;It&#x27;s the compete yang to the yin of &#x27;The White Room&#x27;. It&#x27;ll be very very dense, very very hardcore. No sort of &#x27;up&#x27; choruses or anthems. I think it&#x27;s going to be techno-metal, I think that&#x27;s gonna be the sound. Techno-metal. Which&#x27;ll be, you know, a cross between Techno and Heavy Metal. Megadeth with drum machines.&quot;

It never happened. I (PaulMann) have some thrash-metal versions of White Room tracks, but have no way of verifying their source
