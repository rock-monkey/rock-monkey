It has been widely-circulated that the [[SwearWords swear word]] [[Fuck]] originally came into being as an acronym - &quot;[[Sex Fornication]] Under Consent of the King&quot; or &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; - as a legal term for talking about pre-[[Marriage marital]] [[Sex]]. This has since been debunked as an UrbanLegend.

While the exact origin of &quot;[[Fuck fuck]]&quot; is not known, it does come from a Germanic root and cognates can be found in almost all the Germanic languages. Acronymns are pretty much a 20th century invention. The earliest known acronym is ANZAC (Australia-New Zealand Army Corps), dating to the FirstWorldWar. There are some older words where acronymic phrases were created out of existing words, but none that were created from a phrase until the 20th century.</script>
