    It has been widely-circulated that the <a href="/SwearWords" class="internal">swear word</a> <a href="/Fuck" class="internal">Fuck</a> originally came into being as an acronym - &quot;<a href="/Sex" class="internal">Fornication</a> Under Consent of the King&quot; or &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; - as a legal term for talking about pre-<a href="/Marriage" class="internal">marital</a> <a href="/Sex" class="internal">Sex</a>. This has since been debunked as an <a href="/UrbanLegend" class="broken internal">UrbanLegend</a>.<br />
While the exact origin of &quot;<a href="/Fuck" class="internal">fuck</a>&quot; is not known, it does come from a Germanic root and cognates can be found in almost all the Germanic languages. Acronymns are pretty much a 20th century invention. The earliest known acronym is ANZAC (Australia-New Zealand Army Corps), dating to the <a href="/FirstWorldWar" class="broken internal">FirstWorldWar</a>. There are some older words where acronymic phrases were created out of existing words, but none that were created from a phrase until the 20th century.
