      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">The best [[Techno SynthPop]] band *ever*. Members include Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. All others are just for touring

When Erasure formed, Vince already had something of a reputation amongst [[Techno SynthPop]] fans from Depeche Mode. He&#x27;d already been in TheAssembly and [[Yazoo]] in the meantime. Andy hadn&#x27;t, however he had been in a college band known as Dinger, producing the never-released-except-at-concerts single &quot;Air of Mystery&quot;

They&#x27;ve been around since 1985, and their last single &quot;Breathe&quot; got to number four, showing they are still popular, and not just with their fans. Their highest scoring hit is a tie between &quot;Stop&quot;, which got to number two and just missed the ChristmasNumberOne thanks to CliffRichard with &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot;. Git. The other was &quot;Sometimes&quot;.

Okay, they had a number one with &quot;ABBA-Esque&quot;, but I don&#x27;t count that because it&#x27;s just cover versions

Vince is widely known as a fanatic for synthesizers, and has tried pretty much everything ever made. His sample-CD is called &quot;Lucky Bastard&quot;, in reference to how many he has. He&#x27;s tried everything, including [[analogue]], digital and soft-synths. Has a fondness for [[Moog Moogs]]

Erasure hits include: &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, &quot;Chains of Love&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Love to Hate You&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;
However, Erasure recommended listening is: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Hideaway&quot;, &quot;Drama (Krucial Mix)&quot;, &quot;Fingers and Thumbs (Cold Summers Day)&quot;, &quot;Am I Right?&quot;, &quot;Spiralling (Orchestral mix)&quot; and &quot;Rock Me Gently&quot;

Frequently confused with the PetShopBoys for some reason
