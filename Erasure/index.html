    <h2>Erasure</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    The best <a href="/Techno" class="internal">SynthPop</a> band *ever*. Members include Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. All others are just for touring<br />
When Erasure formed, Vince already had something of a reputation amongst <a href="/Techno" class="internal">SynthPop</a> fans from Depeche Mode. He&#39;d already been in <a href="/TheAssembly" class="internal">TheAssembly</a> and <a href="/Yazoo" class="internal">Yazoo</a> in the meantime. Andy hadn&#39;t, however he had been in a college band known as Dinger, producing the never-released-except-at-concerts single &quot;Air of Mystery&quot;<br />
They&#39;ve been around since 1985, and their last single &quot;Breathe&quot; got to number four, showing they are still popular, and not just with their fans. Their highest scoring hit is a tie between &quot;Stop&quot;, which got to number two and just missed the <a href="/ChristmasNumberOne" class="broken internal">ChristmasNumberOne</a> thanks to <a href="/CliffRichard" class="broken internal">CliffRichard</a> with &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot;. Git. The other was &quot;Sometimes&quot;.<br />
Okay, they had a number one with &quot;ABBA-Esque&quot;, but I don&#39;t count that because it&#39;s just cover versions<br />
Vince is widely known as a fanatic for synthesizers, and has tried pretty much everything ever made. His sample-CD is called &quot;Lucky Bastard&quot;, in reference to how many he has. He&#39;s tried everything, including <a href="/Analogue" class="auto-fixed internal">analogue</a>, digital and soft-synths. Has a fondness for <a href="/Moog" class="broken internal">Moogs</a><br />
Erasure hits include: &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, &quot;Chains of Love&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Love to Hate You&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;<br />
However, Erasure recommended listening is: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Hideaway&quot;, &quot;Drama (Krucial Mix)&quot;, &quot;Fingers and Thumbs (Cold Summers Day)&quot;, &quot;Am I Right?&quot;, &quot;Spiralling (Orchestral mix)&quot; and &quot;Rock Me Gently&quot;<br />
