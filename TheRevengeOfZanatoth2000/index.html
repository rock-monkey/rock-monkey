Chief Inspector Blancheflower looks up impatiently.

&quot;Where have you been? We&#x27;ve got an emergency on our hands.&quot;

He stares hard at you.

&quot;Why does your bag appear to be full of wool?&quot;

You start to explain.

&quot;No time for that now. Where&#x27;s Peter Hain?&quot;

You are about to explain that a dying old tea shop owner and knitting champion told you he was in your bag but then think better of it. So you tell the chief you couldn&#x27;t find him.

&quot;You fucking what? We&#x27;ve got a major problem here Restless. Not only is Zanatoth on the loose, but his Sceptre&#x27;s been stolen from the museum. And you haven&#x27;t even found one lousy fucking perma-tanned politician? You useless twat! Get out, you&#x27;re suspended from duty!&quot;

I guess you&#x27;re on your own.
