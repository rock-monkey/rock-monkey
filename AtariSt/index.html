  <section>
    Cheap home computer of the early 90s. Available in the following forms:<br />
Atari 520 (512k RAM) ST/STF/STM/STFM/STE<br />
Atari 1040 (1024k of RAM) (STFM/STE)<br />
Mega-ST (2Mb of 4Mb of RAM)<br />
Mega-TT (2Mb or 4Mb of RAM)<br />
Stacy (B/W Laptop)<br />
Falcon<br />
Any other Atari products (eg the Atari 400) may look vaguely similar, but they are not.<br />
Operating System simply called TOS (The Operating System). Looked almost identical from 1.00 to 2.06<h3>Atari 520/1040</h3>This is what everyone usually means when they refer to the <a href="/AtariSt" class="internal">AtariSt</a>, since they were by far the most popular<br />
ST was the original incarnation, and had no TV modulator (monitor only) and no built in disk drive (external only)<br />
STF came with a built in disk drive<br />
STM came with a built in modulator<br />
STFM came with both, and was the most popular (TOS 1.4)<br />
STE had a few new tweaks, such as an updated OS, a <a href="/blitter" class="broken internal">blitter</a>, better <a href="/hard" class="broken internal">drive</a> support, stereo sound (with better support for samples), and just to be awkward they moved the video register, causing some 20% of existing software to not work properly... (TOS 1.6/1.62)<br />
Built in MIDI ports. Crap Yamaha bleepy chip thing (1Mhz). Even in the case of the STE, the samples are forced through the YM-2149 (I think) chip, just now in stereo. Woo. This chip also controlled the disk I/O, so incorrect direct hardware access could damage a disk you had in the drive. Yay<br />
Mostly created because Atari were jealous of the <a href="/Amiga" class="internal">Amiga&#39;s</a> success. They removed all the custom chips and to make up for this, they overclocked the CPU from 7.14Mhz to 8Mhz. Great job guys<br />
STFMs had hard soldered RAM chips, whereas the STE used SIMMs<h3>Mega ST/TT</h3>Came in a box with a seperate keyboard. Monitor support only. Either 2mb of RAM or 4. Used quite a lot for DTP work (Calamus) and MIDI work (Cubase), since it was about the only computer around which had built in MIDI ports<br />
The TT ran at 16Mhz, btw<br />
Used TOS 2.05/2.06<h3>Stacy</h3>Never came into contact one, but I believe it was a black and white laptop running TOS 2.06<h3>Falcon</h3>Atari&#39;s last ditch effort to save itself. Quite a nice piece of kit. Came with a meg of RAM, 16Mhz CPU and some really cool direct-hardware graphics stuff. The only Atari capable of playing an MP3 without locking everything else up. Much better sound, which no-one used. Still not as good as an <a href="/Amiga" class="internal">Amiga</a>, but the best piece of software was &quot;Llamazap&quot;, by <a href="/JeffMinter" class="internal">JeffMinter</a>
