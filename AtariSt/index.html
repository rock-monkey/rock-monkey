      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Cheap home computer of the early 90s. Available in the following forms:

Atari 520 (512k RAM) ST&#x2F;STF&#x2F;STM&#x2F;STFM&#x2F;STE
Atari 1040 (1024k of RAM) (STFM&#x2F;STE)
Mega-ST (2Mb of 4Mb of RAM)
Mega-TT (2Mb or 4Mb of RAM)
Stacy (B&#x2F;W Laptop)
Falcon

Any other Atari products (eg the Atari 400) may look vaguely similar, but they are not.

Operating System simply called TOS (The Operating System). Looked almost identical from 1.00 to 2.06

====Atari 520&#x2F;1040====
This is what everyone usually means when they refer to the AtariSt, since they were by far the most popular

ST was the original incarnation, and had no TV modulator (monitor only) and no built in disk drive (external only)
STF came with a built in disk drive
STM came with a built in modulator
STFM came with both, and was the most popular (TOS 1.4)
STE had a few new tweaks, such as an updated OS, a [[blitter]], better [[hard drive]] support, stereo sound (with better support for samples), and just to be awkward they moved the video register, causing some 20% of existing software to not work properly... (TOS 1.6&#x2F;1.62)

Built in MIDI ports. Crap Yamaha bleepy chip thing (1Mhz). Even in the case of the STE, the samples are forced through the YM-2149 (I think) chip, just now in stereo. Woo. This chip also controlled the disk I&#x2F;O, so incorrect direct hardware access could damage a disk you had in the drive. Yay

Mostly created because Atari were jealous of the [[Amiga Amiga&#x27;s]] success. They removed all the custom chips and to make up for this, they overclocked the CPU from 7.14Mhz to 8Mhz. Great job guys

STFMs had hard soldered RAM chips, whereas the STE used SIMMs

====Mega ST&#x2F;TT====
Came in a box with a seperate keyboard. Monitor support only. Either 2mb of RAM or 4. Used quite a lot for DTP work (Calamus) and MIDI work (Cubase), since it was about the only computer around which had built in MIDI ports

The TT ran at 16Mhz, btw

Used TOS 2.05&#x2F;2.06

====Stacy====
Never came into contact one, but I believe it was a black and white laptop running TOS 2.06

====Falcon====
Atari&#x27;s last ditch effort to save itself. Quite a nice piece of kit. Came with a meg of RAM, 16Mhz CPU and some really cool direct-hardware graphics stuff. The only Atari capable of playing an MP3 without locking everything else up. Much better sound, which no-one used. Still not as good as an [[Amiga]], but the best piece of software was &quot;Llamazap&quot;, by JeffMinter</script>
