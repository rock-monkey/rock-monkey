    <div class="wikigame-shortcodes">This page used <a href="/WikiGameToolkit" class="internal">WikiGameToolkit</a> shortcodes, which are not supported in this version of the site.</div>Congratulations! The filing cabinet opens to reveal the <a href="/SceptreOfZanatoth" class="internal">SceptreOfZanatoth</a> inside. You carry the sceptre off to <a href="/PeterHain" class="internal">PeterHain</a> who gives you a luxurious hamper from <a href="/Safeway" class="internal">Safeway</a> and a beach ball for your trouble. <h4>YOU WIN THE GAME!</h4> <br />
If you did it without clicking back once, or cheating, then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m utterly gobsmacked. Even if you did then please sign your name in the comments bit. (if you found this page by just clicking through all the extensions then you should be ashamed of yourself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ <a href="/Fuck" class="internal">fuck</a> off).<br />

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Hello. I cheated a little. I found this game to be a perfect blend of amusement, frustration, tedium, and frivolity. I have wasted many minutes playing this game but you must have wasted more when you created it. For this, I thank you.<br />

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Great work - I fought through it, some clicking back first time (went to Safeway first which fucked me up royally); restarted - barely clicked back the second time (only because I'd gone back to locations like the forest to see what was &quot;South&quot; and to the solarium to see what happens if you &quot;Duel&quot;), but still kicked arse (guessed exactly how to deal with the store manager/rock hammer/goblins first time, and knew the password from Paul/Claire's clues). But then, I kick arse generally.<br />
<br />
A wonderful distraction this morning. Thanks mucho, Andy!</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>
