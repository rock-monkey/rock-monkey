      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">On one side there are the forces of good - [[Human humans]], [[Elves elves]] and [[Dwarfs dwarfs]]. On the other there are the forces of evil - [[Goblins goblins]], [[Ogres ogres]], [[Trolls trolls]] and [[Orcs orcs]]. Of all the noxious inhuman creatures an adventurer must overcome during his quests for fame and fortune, orcs will always be the most frequent of his adversaries. Orcs infest almost everywhere, though they prefer dark underground regions: like [[Goblins goblins]], they dislike sunlight. They are squat, ugly brutes, shorter than a man, but taller than a [[Goblins goblin]]. They have warty brown-green skins, usually covered in a motley assortment of skins, furs and irregular scraps of armour scavenged from previous opponents. Their favourite weapons are serrated swords, whips, flails, morning stars and spears.

Orcs are disgusting, filthy creatures with vile habits to match. They delight in the pain of others, even weaker members of their own race, and they will torture their captives before setting them to work as slaves. The living-quarters of an orc stronghold will be knee-deep in filth and muck, and will be very unhealthy, to say the least. Orcs delight in unsavoury activities. Their favourite food, for example, is a rare dish called [[Elves elf]] intestines in [[Gnomes]]-blood sauce, though when this is out of season trhey have to settle for more mundane delights like rat-gizzard soup, or curried bat surprise.

The armies of the orcs are led by **Great Orcs**. Larger and stronger than common orcs, they are possibly the result of selective breeding with [[Trolls]]. If more than four orcs are encountered, chances are a Great Orc will be lurking nearby. If one is present, it will keep the rest from squabbling and brawling with one another. Orcs are argumentative beasts, who seem to spend more of their time fighting amoung themselves than against the dreaded [[Elves]] and [[Dwarfs]].

Like all the chaotic races, some unfortunate orcs are mutants, with an amazing assortment of deficiencies. They may have strange skins, elongated or shortened limbs, or special powers, such as flying, telepathy and so on. Most mutants are despised by most normal orcs, who treat them as if they were slaves, or mangy dogs suitable only for kicking and beating.</script>
