  My name is Annabella and I am studing AppliedComputerScience at ReadingUniversity and am in my second year. So far it has consisted of a lot of programming and far too much maths!

I met [[AndyKeohane Andy]] in Lower Sixth when we went to the same SixthForm. We had law together and spent most of the lessons PassingNotes to each other. Briefly went out with him too, but it didn&#x27;t last I&#x27;m afraid :(  Still friends with him though...

Anyway, that&#x27;s your random facts of life out of me :)

Additional: Annabella is a HOT name. See JonsGuideToManlyManliness. - JonAtkinson.
