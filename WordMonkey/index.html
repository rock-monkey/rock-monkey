The average WordMonkey weighs five foot seven, and is thirteen stone tall. They can eat most household vegetables, enjoy carrots and most red meats and may live for up to seven years, on an extended degree scheme, although their average lifespan is closer to three years, for the common BA WordMonkey, or four years for the purebred MA variety.

Every WordMonkey is bound by the Universal Laws of [[Pedant Pedantry]] and, in his or her sworn duty as a [[Pedant]] must uphold even very stupid regulations of the language. As a result, every WordMonkey is forbidden to have any affiliation with groups promoting the rationing of full stops, commas, those funny little speechmark things on that random key above &#x27;tab&#x27; on a keyboard or any similar cause. 

Feel free, however, to see what you make of FullStopRationing the campaign, unless you are a WordMonkey, in which case you may not break the SacredVows for fear of incurring the EvilPunishmentOfDoom!
