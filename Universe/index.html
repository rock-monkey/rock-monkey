[[Universe The Universe]] is far too large to comprehend, at least not without a deft analogy.

Imagine that your big toe is the size of the planet [[Earth]]. Now imagine that the rest of you is scaled-up proportionately, otherwise you would look a bit silly.

You decide to order a trowel to tidy up your back garden, but unfortunately the mail order company makes trowels that are 10,000 times too big for you. They have also misjudged the demand for their trowels, and now their warehouse contains an unsold trowel for every human that has ever lived.

But that&#x27;s not all. Outside the warehouse there is a statue of the Unknown Gardener, one of the many millions who died in the gamma quadrant&#x27;s Gardening Wars. The statue stands one million times taller than the warehouse.

But the statue is merely a pawn on an interstellar chessboard made up of 3.2 billion squares. And the chessboard is just one of many intricately carved chessboards lying at the back of a dusty market stall so huge that even a Tesco Extra looks puny in comparison. Thousands of these market stalls gather along the route to the nearby tourist trap, which itself is just one item on the itinerary for an endless line of intergalactic holiday coaches.

Still with us? Now consider this: the universe is large enough to contain a gazillion squillion zillion of these intergalactic coach tours. And not one of the hotels they stop at will look like it did in the brochure.

----
The universe is infinite because it is impossible to make a measurement outside it, any attempt to look outside the universe would result in it&#x27;s expansion. God is cool.
