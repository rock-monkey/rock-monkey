Bearing that in mind...

KnitClub (otherwise known as Aberystwyth Stitch&#x27;n&#x27;Bitch) is a fledging club run by Elin (who will get a wiki page when I know her surname). They meet in a cafÃƒÂ© and [[Knitting knit]]. Elin&#x27;s mum is a textiles professional and Elin is passionate about knitting and welcomes newcomers to join in and learn this art form.

She also works in AndysRecords.

People who attend KnitClub:
SianThomas


----
If you are interested in attending KnitClub and learning to [[Knitting knit]], then go into AndysRecords and speak to the girl behind the counter. It will be Elin. She would love to have you there. Or if you&#x27;re too shy, then ask SianThomas or RestlessBoy and they&#x27;ll ask her for you.</script>
