      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">MattPayne is  another PoliticsMonkey at the UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth although doing European Politics and is therefore unsure which of the two types of PoliticsMonkey he is.

He is an avid (maybe obsessed) Fencer having joined at the university and generally enjoys playing with swords at least twice a week. Sabre is his prefered weapon, followed by foil, he doesn&#x27;t do epee.  However he won a bronze medal for sabre at the Universities of Wales Championships and also won a silver medal for Epee (go figure??) and a gold medal and sheild for Sabre in the Club competition at the university club.  This means he is now also joint MasterAtArms and the proud holder of the CampKnight trophy.

Maybe enjoying a somewhat outmoded sport based on the now defunct fashion of duelling, means he is slightly scared of computors and uses them as hammers, so is somewhat scared at the thought of editing webpages and messing stuff up.
