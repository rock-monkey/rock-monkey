    <a href="/MicrosoftAccess" class="internal">MicrosoftAccess</a> is a database management system produced by <a href="/MicrosoftCorporation" class="internal">MicrosoftCorporation</a> and packaged as part of the <a href="/MicrosoftOffice" class="internal">MicrosoftOffice</a> suite.<br />
While (occassionally) suitable for small, office applications, it becomes unusable as soon as you try to deploy it in a networked environment, or get it to do anything more simplistic than you could equally achieve with a spreadsheet.<br />
Avoid.<br />

&quot;<a href="/OpenOffice" class="internal">OpenOffice</a>&quot; made by sun microsystems is avaliable free and can read and write <a href="/MicrosoftOffice" class="internal">Ms Office</a> formats, it doubtless works on <a href="/Linux" class="internal">Linux</a> too. It performs very nicely. Access is a c##t<br />
(debunk: Actually, &#39;<a href="/OpenOffice" class="internal">OpenOffice</a>&#39; is sponsored by Sun, but it&#39;s open source, so it&#39;s really owned by everyone, made by everyone and for everyone. <a href="/OpenOffice" class="internal">OpenOffice</a> cannot at this time open Microsoft Access files. However, Sun Microsystems do sell a custom, packaged, &#39;supported&#39; version of <a href="/OpenOffice" class="internal">OpenOffice</a>, called <a href="/StarOffice" class="broken internal">StarOffice</a>. I believe this has a database package which may or may not be able to read Access files. I don&#39;t know, because I can&#39;t afford <a href="/StarOffice" class="broken internal">StarOffice</a>.

Speaking as a WordMonkey, I've got no idea, but I imagine the reason you can't get a free copy is because Microsoft are greedy wee sods. In my experience, the only way to get a free copy of anything which isn't open source, or similar, is to get a pirate copy, and that's very naughty and wrong, especially if you're denying money to an enormous multinational.
