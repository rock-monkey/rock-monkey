(debunk: Actually, &#x27;OpenOffice&#x27; is sponsored by Sun, but it&#x27;s open source, so it&#x27;s really owned by everyone, made by everyone and for everyone. OpenOffice cannot at this time open Microsoft Access files. However, Sun Microsystems do sell a custom, packaged, &#x27;supported&#x27; version of OpenOffice, called StarOffice. I believe this has a database package which may or may not be able to read Access files. I don&#x27;t know, because I can&#x27;t afford StarOffice. Sorry for the [[Pedantry pedantry]].

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Wotcha ErnestHarrison. Speaking as a WordMonkey, I've got no idea, but I imagine the reason you can't get a free copy is because Microsoft are greedy wee sods. In my experience, the only way to get a free copy of anything which isn't open source, or similar, is to get a pirate copy, and that's very naughty and wrong, especially if you're denying money to an enormous multinational. Try asking around.</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote></div>
