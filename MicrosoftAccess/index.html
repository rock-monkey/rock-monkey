      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">MicrosoftAccess is a database management system produced by MicrosoftCorporation and packaged as part of the MicrosoftOffice suite.

While (occassionally) suitable for small, office applications, it becomes unusable as soon as you try to deploy it in a networked environment, or get it to do anything more simplistic than you could equally achieve with a spreadsheet.

Avoid.

See also (mostly by contrast) [[SQLLanguage SQL (Language)]].

&quot;OpenOffice&quot; made by sun microsystems is avaliable free and can read and write [[MicrosoftOffice Ms Office]] formats, it doubtless works on [[Linux]] too. It performs very nicely. Access is a c##t

(debunk: Actually, &#x27;OpenOffice&#x27; is sponsored by Sun, but it&#x27;s open source, so it&#x27;s really owned by everyone, made by everyone and for everyone. OpenOffice cannot at this time open Microsoft Access files. However, Sun Microsystems do sell a custom, packaged, &#x27;supported&#x27; version of OpenOffice, called StarOffice. I believe this has a database package which may or may not be able to read Access files. I don&#x27;t know, because I can&#x27;t afford StarOffice. Sorry for the [[Pedantry pedantry]].
