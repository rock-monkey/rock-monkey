As the guard vanishes from sight, you dart forward and leap bravely through the closing gap, into the secret passage.

Inside, it is dark and clammy. You can see nothing, although you can smell old fish. It&#x27;s really quite unpleasant.

You pull your Illumifier from your belt, and flick it to &#x27;purple&#x27;. Instantly, the passage is flooded with bright green light. You make a note to fix the dial when you get home.

Some little way ahead of you, the guard turns. He has dumped the ridiculous pastel-blue sword and oversized helmet, and is now holding a thin curved knife which gleams uncannily in the green light.

&quot;Why are you following me?&quot; He asks, and he doesn&#x27;t sound friendly.

What now?

[[TnS034 Run!]]

Talk:

[[TnS035 &#x27;I... I tripped. Yes, that&#x27;s it! Tripped and fell in here. I&#x27;ll just be leaving, shall I?&#x27;]]
[[TnS036 &#x27;Following? Me?&#x27;]]
[[TnS036 &#x27;I&#x27;m in love with you!&#x27;]]
[[TnS036 &#x27;I was bored.&#x27;]]
[[TnS036 &#x27;I want to steal all your belongings and rape your friends.&#x27;]]</script>
