You walk over to the fountain. It consists of a large statue of a woman in a flowing dress, presumably supposed to be the Elf Queen. Water sprays out of a concealed opening behind her head, forming a crown of moving water. It then falls through a series of channels, running into a clear pool at the statues&#x27;s feet. Moving closer, you see nothing of any interest.

[[TnS008 Tap bits of the statue at random, looking for secret things]]
[[TnS010 Try to push the statue over]]
[[TnS002 Give Up]]
