  <section>
    Would you like to be my girlfriend for 24 hours? I&#39;m looking for a girl who:<br />
<ul><li> Is gay or bisexual</li><li> Preferably has had some experience of being in a relationship with another woman so they know what it&#39;s like and can help me understand</li><li> At least wouldn&#39;t mind spending a day with me and showing me the ropes, as it were...</ul><br />
I want to get sponsored and give the money to <a href="/Nightline" class="internal">Nightline</a>. <a href="/SundeepBraich" class="internal">Sundeep</a> would like to do a sponsored silence for the same cause. I also think it would be the perfect lesson in emphathy for me.<br />
Girls who have suggested themselves to me so far:<br />
<ul><li> <a href="/LizHague" class="internal">LizHague</a></li><li> <a href="/ClaireMelton" class="internal">ClaireMelton</a><hr />See <a href="/Lesbians" class="internal">Lesbians</a></ul><div class="comments"><blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Don't you think this is ever so slightly callous?</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Erm, isn't this whoring? Or at least voyeurism?</div><cite><a href="/MattInTheHat">MattInTheHat</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Yeah! =o) <br />
<br />
But seriously - not necessarily. Worded correctly, it could be &quot;I'm looking for a woman to show me the ropes,&quot; and &quot;Would somebody like to give money to charity at the same time?&quot;</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote></div>
