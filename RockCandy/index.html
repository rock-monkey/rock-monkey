    <h3><a href="/RockCandy" class="internal">Rock (Candy)</a></h3><em>Not to be confused with <a href="/Rock" class="internal">Rock (Not Candy)</a>, or you&#39;re (more) likely to break your teeth, unless you&#39;re a <a href="/Giants" class="broken internal">giant</a>.</em><br />
<a href="/RockCandy" class="internal">Rock</a> is a type of candy, traditionally made in <a href="/Blackpool" class="internal">Blackpool</a>.<h3>How Rock Is Made</h3><em>(note: taken from <a href="http://www.coronationrock.co.uk/" class="broken external">www.coronationrock.co.uk</a> - not yet edited)</em><h4>Mixing &amp; Boiling</h4>Firstly we mix sugar and glucose syrup and using gas fires boil the mixture in large copper pans to a temperature of 150 centigrade. The mixture, called a boiling, is held at this temperature until most of the water content is driven off as steam.<h4>Pouring &amp; Cooling</h4>The boiling is then poured out onto cold steel tables through which water is circulated to help the product to cool.<h4>Colouring and Flavouring</h4>Colours and flavours are added to the boiling to match those ordered.<h4>Lettering</h4>As the boiling cools it has plasticene like texture which enables our experts to build letters and logos using strips of colored toffee.<h4>Completing the Boiling</h4>The letters and the outer case are all wrapped around a central core to make one huge piece of rock... weighing around 60 Kgs.<h4>Pulling</h4>This large piece is now pulled out by hand to the thickness ordered. The thickness of the bars is constantly monitored so that all the finished bars will be the correct size and weight.<h4>Rolling</h4>...then is rolled on long tables. At this point each bar is around six metres long. There is still some heat in the bars, so they are still pliable. Much care needs to be taken to keep the rock straight.<h4>Cooling &amp; Cutting</h4>As the rock is rolled it cools and becomes hard and brittle and is eventually cut to the length ordered using special cutters.<h4>Packing &amp; Dispatch</h4>Finally the rock is labelled and wrapped in cellothane. It is then packed securely for transport to our customers all over the world or taken straight to <a href="/Blackpool" class="internal">Blackpool</a> shops when it is sometimes still warm when put out on the shelves.<h4>The Final Result</h4>And here is the final result, exactly what you see when you bite into our rock candy. We sell the freshest rock in town!<hr /><a href="/CategorySweets" class="internal">CategorySweets</a>
