You speak to the receptionist.

**&quot;You know, this game is really hard! Do you have some kind of hint book or something?&quot;**

&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;We had a hint book, yes: but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s been damaged almost beyond use in a recent fire. All we&#x27;ve got left is this one page...&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

The receptionist shows you a charred piece of paper. Those parts which are legible read:

----
...ue Rock ca. be obt..n.d b. ..seil... do.. ..e .... of the ......... ...........

**... ... d. I get the bucket o.. the man&#x27;s head in the NationalLibraryOfWales?**
You need to apply soap to the bucket to lu..icate it.

**68. W.ere do I g.t the soap?**
The bar of soap can be found in the kitchen a. BranwensRestaurant. You will need to tell the chef that you are t.. new dishwasher to get in there.

**69. Where is the hintbook?**
The hintbook is in the NationalLibraryOfWales. You will need to speak to the receptionist to get it.

**70. How do I get the receptionist at the NationalLibraryOfWales to speak to me? She ignores me in favour of the man with a bucket on his head?**
You need to get the bucket off the man&#x27;s head (clue 67) before the receptionist can talk to you.

**71. The copy of the hintbook at the NationalLibraryOfWales is fire damaged, a.d . ..n.t re.. i..**
T. ..t th. re.. hint..o.; y.. ..l. ne.d .. ..m... ..n...t... a.d a.. .im ...y n..el.y f.. a ..u..

... &#x2F;&#x2F;the rest of the page is entirely unreadable&#x2F;&#x2F;

&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;Sorry, that&#x27;s all I can help you with.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

**What next?**
