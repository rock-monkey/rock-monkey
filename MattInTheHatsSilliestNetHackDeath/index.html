I was travelling through the gnomish mines with some random stuff in my inventory. It was dark, a nymph appears from nowhere and steals an oak wand from me. Bitch! Anyway, set off to hunt her down and get it back. I go round a corner and hear a zap:

Cronos The Samurai; killed by a wand of death.

I was a fresh faced warrior making my way down the gnomish mines when I&#x27;m just minding my own business and I hear a zap:

Cronos The Samurai; killed by a wand of death.

I hate bones files.
