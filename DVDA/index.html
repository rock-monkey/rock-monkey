A rival to [[SACDs]], which uses the same compression algorithm as a Dolby Digital track, but with much less compression, and a higher specification (192 or 96kbps, 24-bit I believe)

====A band====
Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s band, best known for &quot;Warts on your Dick&quot; from BASEketball, &quot;What Would Brian Boitano Do (Part 2)&quot; from South Park - Bigger Longer and Uncut, and &quot;Now You&#x27;re a Man&quot; from Orgazmo. Named after the following:

====A hypothetical sex-act====
Invented in the movie Orgazmo. Something of an urban legend (where would everybody stand?).

&quot;Double Vaginal, Double Anal&quot;

There is no evidence this has ever been accomplished...
