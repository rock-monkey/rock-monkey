&quot;Why?!&quot; I hear you ask! Well, it depends how you got here.

If you got here through [[Chess002 Read a Book]] and picked a thriller you picked choices which put you down as being quiet, dependable and with a firm sense of duty. Which makes you a pawn.

If you got here through [[Chess002 Read a Book]] and picked something for Adults, your choices show you&#x27;re quiet, willing to share and posessed of a slightly exiting edge. Which still makes you a pawn.

If you got here through [[Chess004 Watching TV]] you&#x27;ve shown yourself to be lazy, disinterested in the world around you and pathologically nervous of bad things happening to you. So you&#x27;re a pawn too.

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
