    <strong>You are:</strong><br />
<strong><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;a pawn!!&quot;})</div></strong><br />
&quot;Why?!&quot; I hear you ask! Well, it depends how you got here.<br />
If you got here through <a href="/Chess002" class="internal">Read a Book</a> and picked a thriller you picked choices which put you down as being quiet, dependable and with a firm sense of duty. Which makes you a pawn.<br />
If you got here through <a href="/Chess002" class="internal">Read a Book</a> and picked something for Adults, your choices show you&#39;re quiet, willing to share and posessed of a slightly exiting edge. Which still makes you a pawn.<br />
If you got here through <a href="/Chess004" class="internal">Watching TV</a> you&#39;ve shown yourself to be lazy, disinterested in the world around you and pathologically nervous of bad things happening to you. So you&#39;re a pawn too.<hr />Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#39;personality&#39; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.<br />
