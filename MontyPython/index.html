Oh dear oh dear oh dear. No no and a big whopping NO. Three of the heads were from Cambridge (rather than Canbridge) and they were the taller, TerryGilliam would say more aggressive, members JohnCleese, GrahamChapman and EricIdle. Two of the shorter, more easy going (again, in TerryGilliam&#x27;s opinion) were the Oxford boys of TerryJones and MichaelPalin. TerryGilliam did not attend either institute, I believe, what with him being a former [[Americans yank]].
