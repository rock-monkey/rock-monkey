Descriptions follow of the three main market leaders. Not including low-spec flash-memory models, just 20Gb&#x2F;40Gb hard drive models. To be as far as possible, all have broadly the same attributes, and are costed in US Dollars

====iPod (~87% market share)====
**Price:** 20Gb for $299, 40Gb for $399 (discontinued)
**Formats:** MP3, PCM Waveforms, AAC (iTunes [[DRM]]), AIFF, Audiobook, Apple Lossless
**Features:** iTunes integration, driverless usage, playlist synchronisation, song rating, text viewing (iCal and address book only (Note: 4th Generation iPod&#x27;s can read any text files as long as they&#x27;re in the Notes&#x2F; folder on the iPod. Supports both Unix and Window line-breaks --JonAtkinson)), games, firmware upgradeable.
**Interface:** Front buttons. Simple, yet intuitive
**Connection:** Firewire, later propietory USB2
**Cache:** ~30Mb
**Notes:** Mac only for the first 8 months. Li-Ion battery, around 12-hours, 500 recharges estimated. The only player which can play encrypted iTunes files

====Creative Zen====
**Price:** 20Gb for $2[[69]], 40Gb for $329.99
**Formats:** WMA, MP3, PCM Waveforms, Windows Media, IMA ADPCM
**Features:** FM Radio, voice recorder (built-in mic only), sync with Outlook, Address book and Calendar, EAX
**Interface:** Similar to iPod, but with a vertical strip
**Connection:** USB 2.0 or Firewire
**Cache:** Around 14-15Mb
**Notes:** 11-hours

====iRiver====
**Price:** 20Gb for $285, 40Gb for $369 (discontinued)
**Formats:** MP3, PCM Waveforms, OggVorbis, Windows Media, ASF, 
**Features:** Text viewing (any ASCII), driverless usage (no drivers to transfer files), FM radio, audio recording (with support for external mike and on the fly MP3 encoding), optical in&#x2F;out, firmware upgradeable, playlist synchronisation (with drivers), WinAMP playlist support, 
**Interface:** Horrible. No. Really. Takes some getting used to.
**Connection:** Mini-USB2
**Cache:** Unknown
**Notes:** Has a reputation for providing a higher sound quality than the iPod, even with the provided earphones. However, the H-series have now been discontinued, with nothing between the 5Gb player and the 20&#x2F;40Gb music&#x2F;photo viewers. Li-Polymer quoted at ~16 hours playback

And just for a laugh, my old portable MP3 player before I got my iRiver (- [[PaulMann Paul]])

====mpMan (&quot;Rio&quot;)====
**Price:** About Ã‚Â£120 I think, for my 32Mb model (Upgradable with smartmedia card by up to 32Mb more)
**Formats:** MP3
**Features:** Umm. Playback? Had to install a driver to transfer
**Interface:** Very very simple. But it would be. It didn&#x27;t do anything besides play. Don&#x27;t think it even had random support
**Connection:** Parallel port
**Cache:** None needed. Solid state
**Notes:** Battery life, about 4 hours. Tops.
