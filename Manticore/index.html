Manticores were created centuries ago by an insane warlock from places unknown, fooling with things that should have been left well alone. Using powerful magic, he mixed a lion, a scorpion and a bat together with a human and created the first Manticore. He repeated the experiment many times, until he was finally killed by one of his creations. Since then the monstrosities have scattered into the most inhospitable parts of the world, where their evil natures fester with hatred for all life

A Manticore has the head of an old, bearded man, which flows into the mane and then the body of a large lion. From their powerful shoulders a pair of large, leathery bat&#x27;s wings sprout, and behind them rears a [[scorpion]]-like tail tipped with a sting the size of man&#x27;s head! They will attack with their claws or their sting, alternately slashing and striking at their opponent. In a Manticore&#x27;s lair there will be innumerable bones, the sorry relics of its past victims. There may also be some weapons, equipment or treasure, for it cannot digest such hard items, although it does consume the bones of it&#x27;s victims</script>
