    Very good <a href="/StandUpComedian" class="broken internal">StandUpComedian</a> who unfortunately was made to feel about ten inches tall at <a href="/Aberystwyth" class="internal">Aberystwyth</a> <a href="/ComedyWorks" class="internal">ComedyWorks</a>. Whether or not he actually started to cry is subject to speculation but he certainly didn&#39;t enjoy himself. Which is a shame because everyone was enjoying the set, even when it descended into a chaotic discussion on <a href="/EconomicDevelopment" class="internal">EconomicDevelopment</a>.<br />
<a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> is particularly ashamed of his contribution to this.<hr /><em>&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you, I&#39;m sorry that I made you cry...&quot;</em>
