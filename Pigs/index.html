Highly intelligent pink barnyard-based animals. They are the source of all [[Bacon]] in the world, as only they know where it is hidden. [[Vegetarians]] consider this exploitation and argue that we should not eat bacon, but should allow [[Pigs]] to keep it all for themselves.

The favoured noise of a [[Pigs Pig]] is &#x27;Oink!&#x27;.

A [[Pigs Pig]] was once narrowly beaten as the Conservative candidate for MP for [[Daventry]], it was felt its position on immigration was not strong enough.
