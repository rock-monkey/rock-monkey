This was a band consisting of people who used to be members of a band going under the name &#x27;Pixies&#x27; who recorded the songs originally. However it was not the Pixies. It was a cash cow, moo! By reforming they cheapened everything they&#x27;d ever done before. No one wants to see photos of their idols all fat and old and bald, pretending they still feel the darkness. The Pixies were not a stadium band. They did not play stadium songs. Unless you saw them in a dingy club somewhere before Nirvana made them famous and they split up, you did not see the Pixies. 

Glad you enjoyed it though.
