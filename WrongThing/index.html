Here are a few easy ways to tell if you are doing the WrongThing:

1. Somebody is shouting at you (though this could also be because you are InARelationship).

2. Somebody groans (Though this could also be because you&#x27;re HavingSex).

3. People take money off you (This one could also happen InARelationship).

4. You say something, and somebody hits you (This has the same potential reason as Nos. 1 &amp; 3. O, and 2)

5. Nobody wants to look at you anymore.(This could be because you&#x27;re HavingSex. In front of RandomPeopleInTheStreet)

6. Everybody in Liverpool starts complaining and demanding an apology (This could be because you&#x27;re InARelationship with BorisJohnson)

7. You discover that no matter what you say about whatever it is you&#x27;ve just done, you only make things worse (This &#x2F;&#x2F;is&#x2F;&#x2F; because you&#x27;re InARelationship. &#x2F;&#x2F;And&#x2F;&#x2F; HavingSex. And just said TheWrongName.)

8. All of the above.
