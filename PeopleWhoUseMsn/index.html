MattInTheHat another
RuthVarley does sometimes. &#x27;Cos she&#x27;s too lazy to sign up to some other service.
AlecRichardson does, as do the vast majority of his comuter using amigos
RestlessBoy does, as all the people he would ever want to speak to online use it. If that changes then he will select a better service. Until then... [[bovvered bovvered]].
SianThomas does. She also has ICQ, but doesn&#x27;t have any contacts on it. So never bothers with it. (have you considered adding people like [[DanHuntley Dan]], [[BrynSalisbury Bryn]], [[PaulMann Paul]], [[ClaireMelton Claire]] etc.)
PaulMann uses the protocol, but not the client itself
FayeBromilow uses it too
JimmyCarter does as well, but he *does not* use it to share files over the uni network, not at all, no. (Jimmy, you should be ashamed. There are plenty of other ways to share files without using the ropey MSN protocol - PaulMann)

Enter name in list above if you use this [awful&#x2F;perfectly tolerable] service ([[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scatmania.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2003&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;growing-up&#x2F; Why does Dan think it&#x27;s awful]]?). You might want to consider using [[Jabber]].</script>
