Something very exciting is happening, like, I don&#x27;t know, a meteorite has just hit the new Interpol building or something. The whole place is crawling with the press, and sundry excited onlookers. Where are you?

a) [[Test11 Right out at the forefront. You live for moments like this!]]

b) [[Test12 Exiting the scene before the police can catch up with you...]]

c) [[Test21 Composing a letter of complaint to your MP. This is supposed to be a &#x2F;&#x2F;quiet&#x2F;&#x2F; area.]]

d) [[Test22 Sleeping. If people want your attention, they should do this sort of thing after 3pm.]]

e) [[Test23 Selling things to the crowd. Somebody&#x27;s going to make money from this, why shouldn&#x27;t it be you?]]</script>
