Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are considered a cold water fish, meaning they require low water temperatures and high levels of dissolved oxygen in order to survive.  The optimal temperature for an ideal trout habitat is between 50Ã‚Âº and 65Ã‚Âº F.  They begin to show signs of stress at temperatures exceeding 70Ã‚Âº F, and will most likely die in 80Ã‚Âº F water. Trout can tolerate pH as low as 4.1 and as high as 9.5.  In terms of general habitat, Trout live in many different situations.  Lakes ranging in size as found at Tenterden Trout Waters are ideal.
