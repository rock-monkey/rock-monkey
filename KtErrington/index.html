A fan of much good music (BelleandSebastian, TheKillers, TheMoldyPeaches and NickDrake amongst others) she has also written 2 albums on her guitar and wants to get them recorded as soon as possible. Her guitar is called Queeny, and is very pretty. She likes dried [[pineapple]], [[cats]], [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockmonkey.org.uk&#x2F;GoodFilms good films]] and drinking [[tea]]. She is a [[Vegetarian vegetarian]]. After reading JayenAitch&#x27;s description she has also decided that she is an IndieChic. She wears dungarees, has a lip piercing and is a feminist but she is not a [[Lesbian lesbian]] as [[DanHuntley Dan]] claims. She would however like to indulge in a sponsored [[24HourLesbianExperience]] for charity.
She gets all of MattInTheHat&#x27;s references. This is [[Marvellous marvellous]].
