Does anyone remember a childrens programme called Teabag? It was about a lady called Tabitha Bag, later replaced by Tallula Bag, who lived inside a teapot and watched her friend, a child called TJ, in the dregs in the bottom of her teacup. I think this may actually be responsible for my addiction to tea. - (SuzChilestone)
