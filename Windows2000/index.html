Why?

~-NTFS. Possibly the best filing system ever invented. More flexible security wise than your average [[Unix]] filing system. Ridiculously fast. Introduced with WindowsNT but most home users didn&#x27;t use that.
~-Stable. Hark if you will, [[Linux]] users, but every single crash I&#x27;ve had has been due to faulty hardware. Unlike Windows9x, if an application goes wrong, it doesn&#x27;t tend to bring the whole system down or write into areas it&#x27;s not meant to
~-Non-fluffy. Unlike WindowsXP where [[MicrosoftCorporation Microsoft]] try to hide all the really useful stuff away, Windows2000 lays it bare. Hardware, domain and user administration are simple to control. So what if it&#x27;s a graphical interface? That&#x27;s not a _bad_ thing (except for the possibility it might encourage users to change things they don&#x27;t really understand), and most networking stuff can be done on the command line if you _really_ want to &#x2F;&#x2F;(almost everything can be done on the command-line if you really want to - [[DanHuntley Dan]])&#x2F;&#x2F;
~-Hidden command line. True, command lines are incredibly good for things like pattern recognition (esp. regular expressions), but most humans think in terms of _visual_ things. That&#x27;s why GUIs are so popular. If you absolutely have to use the command prompt, you can, but you&#x27;re not forced to
~-No [[Palladium]]. Unlike WindowsXP, there isn&#x27;t any DRM stuff in Windows2000, unless you install WindowsMediaPlayer (latest version), or ServicePack3 or higher. Even then, it just appears as a service which you can disable &#x2F;&#x2F;(no [[Palladium]] in any version of Windows at all, actually; DRM only exists in WindowsMediaPlayer, which isn&#x27;t included in new versions of Windows sold in Europe anyway - [[DanHuntley Dan]])&#x2F;&#x2F;
~-Intuitive. Believe it or not, the Windows layout has remained almost constant, not just because it&#x27;s more widely recognised, but because it has a very gradual learning curve. But there&#x27;s still no excuse for putting &quot;Shutdown&quot; on the &quot;Start&quot; menu
~-Activemovie. The simplest video player known to Windows. You don&#x27;t need WindowsMediaPlayer. Just type &quot;mplayer2&quot; into the Run command, and have a DirectShow interface. That&#x27;s it. It works.

There&#x27;s still no excuse for the following, but you&#x27;re not forced to use them:

~-IIS. It&#x27;s a horrible webserver, but at least in the Professional edition it doesn&#x27;t come switched on
~-System sounds, animated icons, fading windows etc... Fair enough, practically every [[OperatingSystem OS]] has them, but except for the sounds, they aren&#x27;t turned on by default &#x2F;&#x2F;(not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen animated icons in an un-hacked Windows system: clarify? - [[DanHuntley Dan]])&#x2F;&#x2F;
