    The best <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OperatingSystem</a> <a href="/MicrosoftCorporation" class="internal">Microsoft</a> ever made<br />
Why?<ul></li><li>NTFS. Possibly the best filing system ever invented. More flexible security wise than your average <a href="/Unix" class="broken internal">Unix</a> filing system. Ridiculously fast. Introduced with <a href="/WindowsNT" class="broken internal">WindowsNT</a> but most home users didn&#39;t use that.</li><li>Stable. Hark if you will, <a href="/Linux" class="internal">Linux</a> users, but every single crash I&#39;ve had has been due to faulty hardware. Unlike Windows9x, if an application goes wrong, it doesn&#39;t tend to bring the whole system down or write into areas it&#39;s not meant to</li><li>Non-fluffy. Unlike <a href="/WindowsXP" class="internal">WindowsXP</a> where <a href="/MicrosoftCorporation" class="internal">Microsoft</a> try to hide all the really useful stuff away, Windows2000 lays it bare. Hardware, domain and user administration are simple to control. So what if it&#39;s a graphical interface? That&#39;s not a _bad_ thing (except for the possibility it might encourage users to change things they don&#39;t really understand), and most networking stuff can be done on the command line if you _really_ want to <em>(almost everything can be done on the command-line if you really want to - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</em></li><li>Hidden command line. True, command lines are incredibly good for things like pattern recognition (esp. regular expressions), but most humans think in terms of _visual_ things. That&#39;s why GUIs are so popular. If you absolutely have to use the command prompt, you can, but you&#39;re not forced to</li><li>No <a href="/Palladium" class="internal">Palladium</a>. Unlike <a href="/WindowsXP" class="internal">WindowsXP</a>, there isn&#39;t any DRM stuff in Windows2000, unless you install <a href="/WindowsMediaPlayer" class="broken internal">WindowsMediaPlayer</a> (latest version), or <a href="/ServicePack3" class="broken internal">ServicePack3</a> or higher. Even then, it just appears as a service which you can disable <em>(no <a href="/Palladium" class="internal">Palladium</a> in any version of Windows at all, actually; DRM only exists in <a href="/WindowsMediaPlayer" class="broken internal">WindowsMediaPlayer</a>, which isn&#39;t included in new versions of Windows sold in Europe anyway - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</em></li><li>Intuitive. Believe it or not, the Windows layout has remained almost constant, not just because it&#39;s more widely recognised, but because it has a very gradual learning curve. But there&#39;s still no excuse for putting &quot;Shutdown&quot; on the &quot;Start&quot; menu</li><li>Activemovie. The simplest video player known to Windows. You don&#39;t need <a href="/WindowsMediaPlayer" class="broken internal">WindowsMediaPlayer</a>. Just type &quot;mplayer2&quot; into the Run command, and have a <a href="/DirectShow" class="broken internal">DirectShow</a> interface. That&#39;s it. It works.</li></ul>There&#39;s still no excuse for the following, but you&#39;re not forced to use them:<ul></li><li>IIS. It&#39;s a horrible webserver, but at least in the Professional edition it doesn&#39;t come switched on</li><li>System sounds, animated icons, fading windows etc... Fair enough, practically every <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">OS</a> has them, but except for the sounds, they aren&#39;t turned on by default <em>(not sure I&#39;ve ever seen animated icons in an un-hacked Windows system: clarify? - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a>)</em></li></ul>People who use Windows2000:<ul></li><li> <a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a></li></ul>See also <a href="/WindowsVsLinux" class="internal">WindowsVsLinux</a>
