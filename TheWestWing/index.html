    Some of <a href="/SianThomas" class="internal">SianThomas</a>&#39;s favourite quotes from <a href="/TheWestWing" class="internal">TheWestWing</a>:<br />
Toby: What, do you want to tempt the wrath of the... whatever, from high atop the thing?<hr />C.J. to Toby: I&#39;m crazy about the roundness of your head.<hr />Sam: About a week ago I accidentally slept with a prostitute.<br />
Toby: (pause) Really?<br />
Sam: Yes.<br />
Toby: A prostitute?<br />
Sam: A call girl.<br />
Toby: Accidentally?<br />
Sam: Yes<br />
Toby: I don&#39;t understand. Did you trip over something?<hr />Josh: I really think I&#39;m the best judge of what I mean, you paranoid Berkeley shiksa feminista!<br />
Whoah, that was way too far.<br />
C.J.: No, no. Well, I&#39;ve got a staff meeting to go to and so do you, you elitistist Harvard fascist missed-the-dean&#39;s-list-two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jack-ass!<br />
Josh: Feel better gettin&#39; that off your chest there, C.J.?<br />
C.J.: I&#39;m a whole new woman.<hr />Leo: There are two things in the world you never want people to see how you make them - laws and sausages. <hr />CJ: The more photo-friendly of the two turkeys gets a presidential pardon and a full life at a children&#39;s petting zoo; the other one gets eaten.<br />
<a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: If the Oscars were like that, I&#39;d watch.<hr />Sam: Well, this is bad on so many levels.<hr /><a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: I don&#39;t know, my wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.<br />
Sam: Sir?<br />
<a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: Vitamin C, Vitamin D. Is it possible I&#39;m taking something called euthanasia?<br />
Sam: Echinacea?<br />
<a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: Ah, that sounds more like it. <hr /><a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: I was watching a television program before, with a kind of roving moderator who spoke to a seated panel of young women who were having some sort of problem with their boyfriends -- apparently, because the boyfriends had all slept with the girlfriends&#39; mothers. And they brought the boyfriends out, and they fought, right there on television. Toby, tell me: these people don&#39;t vote, do they?<hr />Sam: Where are you going?<br />
Josh: Where are you going?<br />
Sam: I was following you.<br />
Josh: I was following you.<br />
[awkward pause]<br />
Sam: All right... don&#39;t tell anyone about this, okay? <hr /><a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: In case you were wondering, &quot;Gee, crime... I don&#39;t know,&quot; is when I decided to kick your ass <hr />C.J.: [singing as she crosses the room to Toby] I&#39;m too sexy for my skirt, too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for the other things...<br />
Toby: What in God&#39;s name is...<br />
C.J.: He got the question.<br />
Toby: Who?<br />
C.J.: The Majority Leader.<br />
Toby: When?<br />
C.J.: Last night. Local news, Cleveland, Ohio - oh me-o, oh my-o, oh Cleveland, Ohio! He got the question.<br />
Bonnie: What was the question?<br />
Toby: &quot;Why do you want to be president?&quot;<br />
Bonnie: And what did he say?<br />
C.J.: [reading from a transcript of the interview] &quot;The reason I would run, were I to run, is I have a great belief in this country as a country and in this people as a people that go into making this country a nation with the greatest natural resources and population of people, educated people.&quot;<br />
[makes a shotgun motion with her arms]<br />
C.J.: Chk-chk, boom!<br />
Toby: I&#39;ll spread it around.<br />
C.J.: [singing her way out of the room] I&#39;m too sexy for my shoes, too sexy for the blues, too sexy... <hr />Sam: If you haven&#39;t seen CJ do The Jackal, then you haven&#39;t seen Shakespeare the way it&#39;s meant to be done. <hr />Josh: I&#39;ve been subpoenaed.<br />
Mrs. Landingham: Oh, I&#39;m sorry, dear. Would you like a cookie?<hr /><a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a>: Claudia Jean did you just pinch Toby?<br />
CJ: I&#39;m sorry Sir. It was a professional dispute.<hr />Donna: Why are you a Republican?<br />
Cliff: Because I hate poor people. I hate them Donna. They&#39;re all so...poor. And many of them talk funny, and don&#39;t have proper table manners. My father slaved away at the Fortune 500 company he inherited so that I could go to Choate, Brown, and Harvard, and see that this country isn&#39;t overrun by poor people and <a href="/Lesbians" class="auto-fixed internal">lesbians</a>.
