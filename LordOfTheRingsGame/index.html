      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A board game based on the famous book (the) LordOfTheRings, by JRR Tolkein, and marketed, rather cleverly, on the back of the LordOfTheRingsFilms. Presumably this causes a lot of people who bought it because the liked the CGI in the films to get really confused when you see nonsensical special cards.

The &quot;Special Cards,&quot; generally featuring entirely random subcharacters are helpful to the players because they tilt the balance of power every so slightly in favour of the people who own the game. 

This is necessary because the game is a co-operative game, where every player has to help the other. They are persuaded to refrain from [[MunchkinGame Munchkinly]] tactics by the fact the game is weighted severely in favour of the game, which constitutes the opposition entirely by itself.

Whoever wrote the game was a clever, devious bastard. The success rate is about 1-in-3 on the easy setting.

And it&#x27;s great fun.

The LordOfTheRingsGame is often played at GeekNight
