She calls the editor to the foyer, he interviews you and takes a couple of pictures of you standing with your mouth open trying to look gay-slutty then sends you on your way with two hundred quid in your back pocket.

On your way out the Secretary assures you that now everyone in the town will know who you are. 

&quot;Celebrity Status opens doors for you, you know.&quot; she says. &quot;You&#x27;ll get all kinds of priviledges, doors will open, you&#x27;ll get free stuff, you can jump queues...&quot;
