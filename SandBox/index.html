I&#x27;d noticed that when you want to create new pages, you often create a WikiWord on this page (the SandBox) in order to create it.

There&#x27;s no need to do this, you know - just type the page name into the address bar (so to create a page called RuthVarley, supposing one hadn&#x27;t been created already, you could just append RuthVarley to the http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockmonkey.org.uk&#x2F; in the address bar, or even RuthVarley&#x2F;edit, if you want to go straight into the editor).

On the other hand, it&#x27;s somewhat bad practice to make WikiPages that are not linked to by any other WikiPage - so making a page by creating a link from the SandBox, then destroying that link, is a little bit rude. This is because you may eventually end up with entirely-disconnected pages, which nobody can ever find out about but which still take up space.

Just a thought...

&#x2F;&#x2F;Not any more. Have created a special page just to link to random pages I made (RandomPagesByRuth). - [[RuthVarley Ruth]] &#x2F;&#x2F;
