Part of a much bigger concern known as TrustedComputing, but I&#x27;m putting the main article here because I like the name of the MicrosoftWindows segment (now known as NGSCB)

Trusted Computing. Sounds innocent. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a conspiracy designed to ensure you never have full control of your computer again.

What is it? Ask an official and they&#x27;ll probably fob you off with something about how it enables you to experience a whole new wealth of multimedia. Wrong. We already have access to as much as we want. Restricting our access isn&#x27;t going to make it any easier

Some stages of Trusted Computing have already come into effect. The ultimate aim is to provide an encrypted &quot;service&quot; from all levels. From the file you download right through to the circuit board. And it seems to be working. WindowsXP and Windows 2000 (Service Pack 3 (I think) onwards) come with [[DRM]] services built in.

Now, this is all very well. You don&#x27;t have to use it. You can always make your own, unencrypted digital copies. For now at least. They&#x27;re trying to discourage that by issuing ProtectedMusicCds. Should you have to pay again? No, but they&#x27;d like you to

What about this you may have heard about self-deleting documents which can now be produced by MicrosoftOffice? The ability to create no paper-trail is a scary concept, and will probably just encourage to be even more reckless and carefree than they already are. Send a nasty email and have it remove all the evidence for you! As if MicrosoftWord documents keeping previous versions wasn&#x27;t bad enough...

It gets worse. There are plans to issue [[OperatingSystem Operating Systems]] which are themselves &quot;secure&quot;. They will negotiate with the host PC and will not even boot if the environment doesn&#x27;t match what they were expecting. Sound far fetched? Well... what do you think the WindowsXP activation is for? You change your hardware, you have to re-register. Whoopeee

It gets worse. Again. There are plans to make applications follow the same steps (Indeed, MicrosoftOffice does). If this continues, it will just about kill [[Shareware shareware]], OpenSource software, and indeed OpenSource [[OperatingSystem Operating Systems]] as we know them. Of course, this can&#x27;t happen without support from the hardware manufacturers. Shame [[Intel]] are already a part of the [[TCPA]] isn&#x27;t it?

It may sound far fetched, and it may sound as though I&#x27;m exaggerating here, but we aren&#x27;t that far off. The [[TCPA]] has already formed, ideas have been discussed and some have already been implemented. We&#x27;ve proved time and time again that ideas like [[CSS]], [[DRM]] and ProductActivation can be circumvented, but if they do this on a hardware level, we won&#x27;t even be able to run the tools needed to circumvent them! We are already &quot;advised&quot; by Microsoft that we shouldn&#x27;t install drivers that haven&#x27;t been &quot;cerfified&quot; by them (By this, of course, they mean that the manufacturers didn&#x27;t pay them large sums of money to slap a &quot;Designed for Windows XP&quot; sticker on their product). Some implementations question any programs you try and run which aren&#x27;t recognised. How long before they just say no?

How long before you do?
