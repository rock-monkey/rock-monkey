    Warning :- Biased<br />
Part of a much bigger concern known as <a href="/TrustedComputing" class="internal">TrustedComputing</a>, but I&#39;m putting the main article here because I like the name of the <a href="/MicrosoftWindows" class="internal">MicrosoftWindows</a> segment (now known as NGSCB)<br />
Trusted Computing. Sounds innocent. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a conspiracy designed to ensure you never have full control of your computer again.<br />
What is it? Ask an official and they&#39;ll probably fob you off with something about how it enables you to experience a whole new wealth of multimedia. Wrong. We already have access to as much as we want. Restricting our access isn&#39;t going to make it any easier<br />
Some stages of Trusted Computing have already come into effect. The ultimate aim is to provide an encrypted &quot;service&quot; from all levels. From the file you download right through to the circuit board. And it seems to be working. <a href="/WindowsXP" class="internal">WindowsXP</a> and Windows 2000 (Service Pack 3 (I think) onwards) come with <a href="/DRM" class="internal">DRM</a> services built in.<br />
Now, this is all very well. You don&#39;t have to use it. You can always make your own, unencrypted digital copies. For now at least. They&#39;re trying to discourage that by issuing <a href="/ProtectedMusicCds" class="internal">ProtectedMusicCds</a>. Should you have to pay again? No, but they&#39;d like you to<br />
What about this you may have heard about self-deleting documents which can now be produced by <a href="/MicrosoftOffice" class="internal">MicrosoftOffice</a>? The ability to create no paper-trail is a scary concept, and will probably just encourage to be even more reckless and carefree than they already are. Send a nasty email and have it remove all the evidence for you! As if <a href="/MicrosoftWord" class="internal">MicrosoftWord</a> documents keeping previous versions wasn&#39;t bad enough...<br />
It gets worse. There are plans to issue <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">Operating Systems</a> which are themselves &quot;secure&quot;. They will negotiate with the host PC and will not even boot if the environment doesn&#39;t match what they were expecting. Sound far fetched? Well... what do you think the <a href="/WindowsXP" class="internal">WindowsXP</a> activation is for? You change your hardware, you have to re-register. Whoopeee<br />
It gets worse. Again. There are plans to make applications follow the same steps (Indeed, <a href="/MicrosoftOffice" class="internal">MicrosoftOffice</a> does). If this continues, it will just about kill <a href="/Shareware" class="broken internal">shareware</a>, <a href="/OpenSource" class="broken internal">OpenSource</a> software, and indeed <a href="/OpenSource" class="broken internal">OpenSource</a> <a href="/OperatingSystem" class="internal">Operating Systems</a> as we know them. Of course, this can&#39;t happen without support from the hardware manufacturers. Shame <a href="/Intel" class="broken internal">Intel</a> are already a part of the <a href="/TCPA" class="internal">TCPA</a> isn&#39;t it?<br />
It may sound far fetched, and it may sound as though I&#39;m exaggerating here, but we aren&#39;t that far off. The <a href="/TCPA" class="internal">TCPA</a> has already formed, ideas have been discussed and some have already been implemented. We&#39;ve proved time and time again that ideas like <a href="/CSS" class="broken internal">CSS</a>, <a href="/DRM" class="internal">DRM</a> and <a href="/ProductActivation" class="broken internal">ProductActivation</a> can be circumvented, but if they do this on a hardware level, we won&#39;t even be able to run the tools needed to circumvent them! We are already &quot;advised&quot; by Microsoft that we shouldn&#39;t install drivers that haven&#39;t been &quot;cerfified&quot; by them (By this, of course, they mean that the manufacturers didn&#39;t pay them large sums of money to slap a &quot;Designed for Windows XP&quot; sticker on their product). Some implementations question any programs you try and run which aren&#39;t recognised. How long before they just say no?<br />
How long before you do?<br />
