&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;Shitty university canteen which doles out food you thought you&#x27;d left behind at SecondarySchool.&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;

Branwens is a UWA mess-hall. More specifically, it&#x27;s split into Branwens Upper (which do hot food at lunch time, and aren&#x27;t open in the evenings), and the original Branwens (which does hot food in the evenings and shitty baguettes at lunchtime). 

Branwen&#x27;s is open from 8am to 7pm, Monday to Friday, and 10am to 2pm on weekends. Branwens Uppen is open from noon to 2pm on weekdays, and never at weekends. 	 	

One of the few good things about Branwens, is the free WiFi access.

The &#x27;official&#x27; Branwens web page is [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aber.ac.uk&#x2F;residential&#x2F;hospitality&#x2F;branwens.shtml here]].

===Hilarious Joke===

Q. What the difference between Branwens food and sewer sludge?
A. Not much. It doesn&#x27;t look that appetising, smells like shit, and will return to the sewer in a days time.
