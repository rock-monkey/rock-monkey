==== About TromaNightAdventure ====

This is a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] by DanHuntley, powered by the WikiGameToolkit.

In TromaNightAdventure you must quest to save TromaNight, collecting the films, refreshments, and the stars, and putting on a show.

If you want to play, just click below:

==== @@[[TromaNightAdventure000 Start The Game!]]@@ ====

=== Current Max. Score: 175 (6 Stars + 5 Films + 3 Pizzas + RealAle + Some Extras) ===

This game uses RockMonkeySessions: you will need to be logged in to play this game, and if you do not do anything for about 20 minutes all of your objects and tokens will be lost, and you will need to start the game again.

----

==== More About The Game ====

The game is unique amongst all known WikiGames that exist to-date in the following areas:

~- **Non-Linear**: It&#x27;s possible to finish this [[WikiGames WikiGame]] in a number of ways. You don&#x27;t &#x2F;&#x2F;have&#x2F;&#x2F; to get all of the TromaNight stars to TromaNight - three (of your choice) will do... but each extra star is worth extra points, and some of the stars have special abilities of thier own which might help you in your quest.

~- **Multiple Solutions**: Each different subquest may have different ways to solve it... and some do not have to be solved at all. Of these, different solutions may provide different numbers of points, but any solution can lead to completion of the game.

~- **Adaptive**: The game responds differently depending on the way in which you go about things. If you take a particular two people to a particular place, you may get a special message (for example, take JonAtkinson and MisterJTA to Wetherspoons and they&#x27;ll chat about the age of the people being served).

~- **Continuously Growing**: The game will continue to be enhanced over the coming months, adding new features, new ways to win, and other goodies.

----

==== Version History &amp; Bugs ====

Over the initial period of the launch of the game, it&#x27;s expected that many minor changes (for example, **v0.915**, which basically just improves the conversation skills of AndyKeohane) will be made. Major changes will be highlighted, in order that you can more easily find them - there&#x27;s no need to play through the game again just because a minor change has been made: wait for a major change!

=== Version History ===
**v1.06** - 11:46, 11th December 2004 - Resized unbelievabley large images to a more believable size.

**v1.05** - 10:56, 10th December 2004 - completed &#x27;empty bullets&#x27; fixes. Game now looks cleaner on [[InternetExplorer IE]]&#x2F;[[MozillaFirefox Firefox]] and doesn&#x27;t give players an advantage by letting them see bullet points for options that don&#x27;t yet exist.

**v1.03** - 15:23, 9th December 2004 - fixed &#x27;manhole opener WikiGameToolkit Error&#x27; (was caused by typo during &#x27;empty bullets&#x27; fixes); thanks [[MisterJTA JTA]] for finding that one! Also fixed &#x27;empty bullets&#x27; 218-231.

**v1.02** - 12:26, 9th December 2004 - fixed &#x27;empty bullets&#x27; problem on scenes 123-217. Fixed bug in collection and use of handbag that would typically prevent players from getting the Arty Film. Keep reporting bugs back to me!

**v1.01** - 11:35, 9th December 2004 - fixed &#x27;empty bullets&#x27; problem on scenes 000-122. Improved conversation with man-with-bucket-on-head (now able to &#x27;free&#x27; him at any point in the conversation, not just at the beginning). Improved HollywoodPizza (now not possible to order Pizza With Vegetables if you already have one).

++**v1.0** - MAJOR CHANGE++ - 16:01, 7th December 2004 - now possible to get **full score** (175 points). Arty Film added, made RuthVarley useful, etc.

**v0.92** - 16:35, 6th December 2004 - added pictures to the nature reserve, national library, parts of campus and bits of the prom and beach.

**v0.917** - 13:18, 6th December 2004 - if you &#x27;cheat death&#x27; by pressing the back button, the game will deduct 50 points from you if you eventually win.

**v0.916** - 11:26, 6th December 2004 - you can now ask DanHuntley for a list of some of the &#x27;extra challenges&#x27; you can do for extra points, and some general tips.

**v0.915** - 10:59, 6th December 2004 - if you have AndyKeohane and you&#x27;re walking along the beach, you can repeatedly stop to ask him &quot;What kind of rock is that?&quot;.

**v0.91** - 17:16, 5th December 2004 - minor bug fixes: [[PaulMann Paul]]&#x27;s conversation is cleaned up, formatting is fixed, typo is corrected.

**v0.9** - 14:20, 5th December 2004 - first release. Not possible (yet) to get &quot;Arty Film&quot;, but still winnable and still possible to get 165&#x2F;175 points. Not fully tested - please report bugs by adding to the list, below. Hints not written yet. Conversations with RuthVarley and PaulMann need fleshing out. Feedback welcome.

=== Known Bugs ===
Please report bugs below:

~- Typo during conversation with Paul (capital B where there shouldn&#x27;t &#x27;be&#x27; one)

== Fixed Bugs ==
~- Page 126 - &quot;...Room Room...&quot; insead of Rock Room - &#x2F;&#x2F;Minor typo, fixed 2004-12-05 17:02&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- L&#x27;Escala has some funkiness - &#x2F;&#x2F;Minor formatting issue, fixed 2004-12-05 17:03&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- The conversation with Paul is... even more cryptic than you intended. - &#x2F;&#x2F;Logic quirks in the conversation, fixed 2004-12-05 17:16&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- Page 204 - &#x27;Never mind&#x27; link goes to the wrong place (same also discovered to occur &quot;Outside Somerfield&quot;) - &#x2F;&#x2F;Fixed link, 2004-12-05 22:09&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- Not possible to get Arty Film - &#x2F;&#x2F;Fixed as part of v1.0&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- Still not possible to get Arty Film (handbag problem) - &#x2F;&#x2F;Fixed as part of v1.02&#x2F;&#x2F;
~- 005 throws up a Wiki Game Toolkit error&quot; where it used to let you take the manhole cover opener
~- IE and Mozilla incorrectly render the &#x27;empty&#x27; bulleted lists, showing players the existance of options that they don&#x27;t yet have access to! Surprised it took so long before somebody reported this - it&#x27;s now being repaired. This is **not** a critical bug, but it does make the game significantly easier for users of some web browsers.
