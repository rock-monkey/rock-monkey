    <a href="/PresidentBartlet" class="internal">PresidentBartlet</a> is the fictional President of the United States, portrayed by <a href="/MartinSheen" class="internal">MartinSheen</a> in <a href="/TheWestWing" class="internal">TheWestWing</a>. <br />
From NBC.com:<br />
&quot;After serving three terms as a U.S. Congressman and two terms as the Governor of New Hampshire, Josiah &quot;Jed&quot; Bartlet realized his dream of becoming President of the United States of America. A deeply religious man, President Bartlet attended Notre Dame University with the thought of becoming a priest. After deciding against that, Bartlet received a <a href="/PhD" class="broken internal">PhD</a> in Economics from the London School of Economics. As President, he often slides into the role of professor and mentor, and still turns to God for advice when facing any kind of crisis. He&#39;s been married to the First Lady, Abigail, for thirty-two years and they have three daughters, Liz, Ellie and Zoey. Barlet claims he is a direct descendant of one of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence. The President recently revealed to his staff and the American public that he has multiple sclerosis.&quot;<br />
