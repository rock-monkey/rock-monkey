In fact, that&#x27;s a lie to begin with. It&#x27;s sole purpose is to restrict your rights on what you can do with your music

For example, one aspect might say you can play a song only a certain number of times, or at a lower bitrate unless you pay for it, or only on a certain number of devices, or you can&#x27;t copy it

It&#x27;s a nice idea, but suffers from severely flawed implementation

For example, with some DRM, if you format your hard drive or move to a new computer, you can&#x27;t take your songs with you (A lot of online stores now let you download files as often as you like, to circumvent this problem)

Or you can listen to them, but if you want to put them onto your portable music player, you have to pay again

DRM files require a DRM-enabled player. WinAMP won&#x27;t work. You *have* to use Windows Media Player to play WMA&#x2F;DRM files. Or how about the only portable player allowed to decrypt iTunes songs is... the iPod?

Some DRM files do sneaky stuff. For example, I have a 5.1 system connected via digital-output to my sound card. Since PCs are &quot;noisy&quot; environments, I decode my digital files outside the box to get a clearer signal. When playing WMA&#x2F;DRM, Microsoft turn off the digital out from my soundcard. Thanks guys.
