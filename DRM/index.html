    Digital Rights Management<br />
In fact, that&#39;s a lie to begin with. It&#39;s sole purpose is to restrict your rights on what you can do with your music<br />
For example, one aspect might say you can play a song only a certain number of times, or at a lower bitrate unless you pay for it, or only on a certain number of devices, or you can&#39;t copy it<br />
It&#39;s a nice idea, but suffers from severely flawed implementation<br />
For example, with some DRM, if you format your hard drive or move to a new computer, you can&#39;t take your songs with you (A lot of online stores now let you download files as often as you like, to circumvent this problem)<br />
Or you can listen to them, but if you want to put them onto your portable music player, you have to pay again<br />
DRM files require a DRM-enabled player. <a href="/WinAMP" class="internal">WinAMP</a> won&#39;t work. You *have* to use Windows Media Player to play WMA/DRM files. Or how about the only portable player allowed to decrypt iTunes songs is... the iPod?<br />
Some DRM files do sneaky stuff. For example, I have a 5.1 system connected via digital-output to my sound card. Since PCs are &quot;noisy&quot; environments, I decode my digital files outside the box to get a clearer signal. When playing WMA/DRM, Microsoft turn off the digital out from my soundcard. Thanks guys.<br />

So use Linux :-) You can decode WMA9 files without problems, using a variety of backends to suit (mplayer, Xine, Gstreamer), with or without respecting the DRM rules. You can even get software to strip out the DRM junk. It's free and in speech, not just as in beer.</div><cite><a href="/JonAtkinson">JonAtkinson</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">I do wish you'd stop with this &quot;Just use Linux&quot; argument. It doesn't help that it _still_ doesn't do the things I use my PC for, and saying &quot;Just use Linux&quot; isn't going to change that, is it?</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">But the DRM will be there no matter which OS you use. Circumventing it (potentially illegally due to the DMCA) is only a short term solution, and if the restricted hardware comes into action (see Palladium) then using Linux isn't going to help...</div><cite><a href="/PaulMann">PaulMann</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">It will if enough people do so. Palladium, as Microsoft's DRM project used to be called, will only become an accepted standard if Windows remains dominant, AND people accept DRM. Only if it becomes accepted will people be able to reasonabley sell protected works. Otherwise, any company selling such works will go out of business.<br />

A sufficient number of people acting now can prevent a DRM-full future.</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Here's a suggestion, brnt-cache-2.server.ntli.net: don't download DRM'd music in the first place. Here's another: take your problem to an actual DRM forum or newsgroup or something: we're just professional ranters.</div><cite><a href="/DanHuntley">DanHuntley</a></cite></blockquote></div>
