Our story is about Three men, a small goldfish and a gospel choir from Borth.
The goldfish is called Bob, possibly due to a lack of imagination in the owner.

They raped a monkey. I kid you not. The poor monkey was fucked until it died from internal bleeding, which isn&#x27;t a nice way for a simian to go, let me assure you.

They did it inside a speedboat which was transporting a camel which was dying of a bum infection to a special camel hospital in Beirut.

Then BrynSalisbury came along. He was out of breath, and clutching a copy of the SundayTimesCrossword. For some reason, he was wearing a dressing gown and some WellingtonBoots.

they all flew up 2 space on a deformed chiwawa an ate 69 packets of polos each!

A metorite came crashing down to Earth and hit someone in the back of the head. Who is not important they died and probably contributed nothing to the Universe anyway. The important thing was the metorite was blue.

Suddenly... the porters rushed in with mugs of tea.

everyone involved was teleported to a secret cave with blackjack and hookers. They all had the time of their lives, until four months later when they ran out of booze. Then they went home.
