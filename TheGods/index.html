Also, the name of the third (or sometimes fourth) gallery up in big theatres. TheGods is a long way away from the action, and because their basically level with the ceiling the people sitting there can&#x27;t really tell what&#x27;s happening on stage. Why it&#x27;s called TheGods, I wouldn&#x27;t deign to guess.
