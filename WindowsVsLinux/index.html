~-Don&#x27;t cite anything you can&#x27;t prove (you don&#x27;t have to link to proof, but be prepared to back it up...).
~-Don&#x27;t be personal
~-Don&#x27;t belittle an OS based on something which no longer affects it (eg Windows being unstable because of DOS, or almost total lack of hardware support in Linux. The former is now untrue, and the latter is almost completetly eradicated)
~-Assume Windows XP, and popular [[Distributions distributions]] such as [[Fedora]], [[Mandrake]] and [[Ubuntu]], due to their widespread usage. Do not cite Windows 9x, NT or 2000, or &quot;business&quot; distributions such as [[SuSe]] or [[Debian]]. This article is strictly about modern home users

Arguments in favour of Windows:

~- No RichardStallman

~- It&#x27;s more compatible for popular software due to it&#x27;s..er.. popularity

~- It&#x27;s interface is much better known, so there is practically no learning curve, even for people who haven&#x27;t used computers before (once you get around the hardware jump, that is)

Arguments in favour of Linux:

~- No BillGates or SteveBallmer

~- You get far less people saying &quot;Can you fix my computer for me?&quot; when you answer &quot;No, I&#x27;ve not used Windows in 8 years&quot;. Which is &#x2F;&#x2F;so&#x2F;&#x2F; nice :-)

~- It&#x27;s free

~- It&#x27;s OpenSource, so if you don&#x27;t like the way something is done, or if it doesn&#x27;t support something you want to do, change it!

~- Most viruses and such like don&#x27;t tend to attack [[Linux]] systems. This may be because not nearly as many people use it (so it&#x27;s not worth the time writing one), or because of it&#x27;s distribution methods, fixes can be sent out within hours
