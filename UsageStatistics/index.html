RockMonkey now records UsageStatistics, so that [[AndyKeohane the owner]] can better understand what&#x27;s going on among the site visitors. Here&#x27;s some of the more interesting things the logs have revealed:

~- 3rd January 2005: &quot;&quot;BT CentralPlus&quot;&quot; user (using InternetExplorer on [[MicrosoftWindows Windows]] XP) searched on [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.altavista.com&#x2F; AltaVista UK]] for &#x27;&quot;&quot;RentBoys&quot;&quot;&#x27;... and got the second result: RentBoys on RockMonkey. I can&#x27;t help but feel that this result will have been unsatisfactory, and they were evidently looking for something a little dirtier too, because they then clicked the &quot;[[BadPages Bad Pages]]&quot; link in the menu, before being unsatisfied there, too, and leaving.

~- 3rd January 2005: &quot;&quot;BT OpenWorld&quot;&quot; user (using InternetExplorer 6 on [[MicrosoftWindows Windows]] 98) searched on [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.co.uk&#x2F; Google UK]] for &#x27;&quot;&quot;jet gladiators games mistress&quot;&quot;&#x27;, using the &quot;pages from the UK&quot; option.  This somehow brought them (second result) to [[Jet our page on Jet]]. They didn&#x27;t hang around long after that.

~- 5th January 2005: Mystery user (using InternetExplorer 6 on [[MicrosoftWindows Windows]] 98) searched on [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.yahoo.com&#x2F; Yahoo! Search]] for &quot;what is a tsunami what is a tidalwave&quot;. The results in front of them won&#x27;t have looked that good... except for one about half-way down the results - a page called [[Tsunami RockMonkey&#x2F;Tsunami]] who&#x27;s search summary was &quot;Not a TidalWave...&quot;. Wow - just what our searcher was looking for; a definition of the difference between the two. They came to our [[Tsunami]] page, and sadly discovered that in actual fact, *all* it contained was the text &quot;Not a TidalWave.&quot; They clicked the link to TidalWave, hoping that would shed some light on the difference... &quot;Surprisingly a wave caused by tides.&quot;

~- 21st January 2005: Thanks to much cross-linking and an unusual word, RockMonkey is now the top web site when searching on [[Google]] for [[Lesbeens]].

~- Popular search terms leading people to RockMonkey include: &#x27;thepolice sting&#x27;, &#x27;hashbrownies&#x27;, &#x27;mozillafirefox&#x27;, &#x27;godspeedyoublackemperor&#x27;, and &#x27;aseriesofunfortunateevents&#x27;. Whether these people meant to type [[WikiWord WikiWords]] or just lost the use of thier space bar is not certain.</script>
