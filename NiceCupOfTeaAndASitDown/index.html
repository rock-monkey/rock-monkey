By golly we can&#39;t be doing without this, now can we? It&#39;s integral to <a href="/Life" class="internal">Life</a>. It makes almost everything better. When you&#39;re sat around not knowing what you need you can bank on the fact that what&#39;s missing is a <a href="/NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown" class="internal">NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown</a>.<br />
One of the huge factors in this activity is the <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a>. Please note the abscence of a capital letter -- especially when compared to <a href="/Coffee" class="internal">Coffee</a> -- because it&#39;s a laid back drink. You have this to calm the world down. Had <a href="/AdolfHitler" class="broken internal">AdolfHitler</a> sat down with a good cuppa earlier in his &#39;career&#39; then who knows what might have gone differently?<br />
Now, as I was saying, tea is essential when enjoying the aforementioned activity and therefore many people seek clarification; what sort of <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a>? Can we have biscuits? How long should the <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a> brew? What sort of biscuits can we have? Do we need to use a teapot? We experience drinkers-of-tea and sitters-of-down forgive them their youthful exuberance. Once they&#39;ve had a <a href="/NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown" class="internal">NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown</a> they&#39;ll realise the truth, the simple truth: stop fussing, it&#39;ll turn out right in the end.<br />
A <em>suggestion</em> on the sitting down side side of things is that you aim more for a slump than a slouch. A good rule of thumb is to imagine that you&#39;re visiting older realives; you don&#39;t have to be prim and proper but you can&#39;t exactly lie down over the sofa. Besides, if you&#39;re slouching like that you&#39;ll probably spill your <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a>.<br />
The reason not to spill your <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a>, aside from the fact that you can&#39;t drink what you&#39;ve spilt down your shirt, is because the <a href="/Tea" class="internal">tea</a> will be hot. Some people are more familiar with the drink of iced tea <em>&lt;spit&gt;</em>. This drink is an <strong>abomination</strong>. That&#39;s all there is to say about that.<br />
<a href="/IfYouReadThis" class="internal">IfYouReadThis</a> you should go and have a <a href="/NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown" class="internal">NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown</a>.
