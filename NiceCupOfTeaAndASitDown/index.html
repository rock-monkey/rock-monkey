By golly we can&#x27;t be doing without this, now can we? It&#x27;s integral to [[Life]]. It makes almost everything better. When you&#x27;re sat around not knowing what you need you can bank on the fact that what&#x27;s missing is a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown.

One of the huge factors in this activity is the [[Tea tea]]. Please note the abscence of a capital letter -- especially when compared to [[Coffee]] -- because it&#x27;s a laid back drink. You have this to calm the world down. Had AdolfHitler sat down with a good cuppa earlier in his &#x27;career&#x27; then who knows what might have gone differently?

Now, as I was saying, tea is essential when enjoying the aforementioned activity and therefore many people seek clarification; what sort of [[Tea tea]]? Can we have biscuits? How long should the [[Tea tea]] brew? What sort of biscuits can we have? Do we need to use a teapot? We experience drinkers-of-tea and sitters-of-down forgive them their youthful exuberance. Once they&#x27;ve had a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown they&#x27;ll realise the truth, the simple truth: stop fussing, it&#x27;ll turn out right in the end.

A &#x2F;&#x2F;suggestion&#x2F;&#x2F; on the sitting down side side of things is that you aim more for a slump than a slouch. A good rule of thumb is to imagine that you&#x27;re visiting older realives; you don&#x27;t have to be prim and proper but you can&#x27;t exactly lie down over the sofa. Besides, if you&#x27;re slouching like that you&#x27;ll probably spill your [[Tea tea]].

The reason not to spill your [[Tea tea]], aside from the fact that you can&#x27;t drink what you&#x27;ve spilt down your shirt, is because the [[Tea tea]] will be hot. Some people are more familiar with the drink of iced tea &#x2F;&#x2F;&lt;spit&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;. This drink is an **abomination**. That&#x27;s all there is to say about that.

IfYouReadThis you should go and have a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown.</script>
