      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Pink noise has a spectral frequency of 1&#x2F;f and is found mostly in nature. It is the most natural sounding of the noises. By equalizing the sounds, you can generate rainfall, waterfalls, wind, rushing river, and other natural sounds. 

Pink noise is exactly between brown and white noise (which is why some people used to call it tan noise, but pink was more appealing). It is neither random nor predictable. It has a fractal-like nature when viewed. When zoomed in, the pattern looks identical to when zoomed out, except at a lower amplitude.

Why, what did you think it meant?</script>
