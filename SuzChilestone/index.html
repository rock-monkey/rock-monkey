suzanne currently lives in [[italy]]. until recently, she lived in [[germany]]

she likes: 
polos and rainbows and schnitzel with [[mittens]]... or something 
the colour pink 
hippos 
AlecRichardson
[[tea]]
cold toast with [[bovril]] on it
baileys

SuzChilestone is a [[LanguagesStudent]]

she will have ten babies. 

she has two goldfishies, they are beautiful, their names are ailsa (my first fish was called alf, ailsa was alf&#x27;s wife in home and away) and butch. sadly, she had to give them to AlecRichardson. they kiss at him now.

she rarely uses capital letters, because they make a sentance look untidy. her hands are also rather small, making it a pain in the arse to hold the shift key down and type at the same time. 

she finds tall people frightening.

She is pretty and clean and hardworking and will make a beautiful mother to our brown haired children (we intend to beat any blonds that creep in by genetic freakery). I love everything about Suz and she makes me happy, i wish she was here right now. AlecR
