<a href="/SuzChilestone" class="internal">SuzChilestone</a> is a <a href="/LanguagesStudent" class="internal">LanguagesStudent</a><br />
she will have ten babies. <br />
she has two goldfishies, they are beautiful, their names are ailsa (my first fish was called alf, ailsa was alf&#39;s wife in home and away) and butch. sadly, she had to give them to <a href="/AlecRichardson" class="internal">AlecRichardson</a>. they kiss at him now.<br />
she rarely uses capital letters, because they make a sentance look untidy. her hands are also rather small, making it a pain in the arse to hold the shift key down and type at the same time. <br />
she finds tall people frightening.<br />
She is pretty and clean and hardworking and will make a beautiful mother to our brown haired children (we intend to beat any blonds that creep in by genetic freakery). I love everything about Suz and she makes me happy, i wish she was here right now. <a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a><hr /><a href="/CategoryWikiPeople" class="internal">List of all wiki people</a>
