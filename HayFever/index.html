    <a href="/HayFever" class="internal">HayFever</a> is a comic play written by Noel Coward in 1924 and first produced in 1925. Best described as a cross between high farce and a comedy of manners, the play is set in a British country house in the 1920s, and deals with the four eccentric members of the Bliss family and their outlandish behaviour when they each invite a guest to spend the weekend. Following on from the success of his earlier play <a href="/TheVortex" class="broken internal">TheVortex</a>, <a href="/HayFever" class="internal">HayFever</a> was an enormous hit on the <a href="/WestEnd" class="internal">WestEnd</a> stage and has been revived countless times around the world since then. It was the 1966 National Theatre production of <a href="/HayFever" class="internal">HayFever</a>, starring Maggie Smith and Edith Evans with Coward himself directing, which sparked the revival of interest in his work toward the end of his life.
