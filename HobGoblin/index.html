2. Possible the result of interbreeding between [[Goblins]] and [[Orcs]]. Hobgoblins are tall gangling creatures encountered in many wild areas. Unlike [[Goblins]], with whom they will sometimes be living, they are not afraid of sunlight, and make fearsome opponents both above and below ground. They are as tall as men, typically dress in tattered clothes and armour stolen from past opponents, and carry swords or spiked clubs. Like their cousins they revel in torture and death, especially where [[Elves]] are concerned. They are ugly, warty-skinned things, and hate anything that is in the slightest way graceful or pretty (hence [[Elves]]).

Hobgoblins may be encountered living in primitive settlements is isolated lands, but most of their number serve in the armies of Chaos alongside their inhuman cousins. They are hardy fighters, and may sometimes be encountered leading small companies of [[Goblins]] or [[Orcs]] into battle. Despite such a rare gift for discipline, they will just as quickly lose it if faced with an [[Elves Elf]] or two, and will attack them rabidly without thought for their commands.
