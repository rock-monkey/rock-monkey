      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A condition in which a [[Catholic]] receives one or more of the wounds that were inflicted upon JesusChrist in the run up to [[Passover]].

[[JesusChrist Jesus]] (I&#x27;m going to avoid JesusChrist as it attaches religious connotations to the historical character and it&#x27;ll avoid the debate) was [[MisterJTA whipped]]. The device used would likely have included bones plaited into the cord (anyone else a little bit disconcerted by the combination of flagelation and plaiting?) so that it would have torn chunks from the flesh.

After that thorns were twisted into a crown and forced upon his head.

Thirdly, when he was [[Crucified crucified]] he was nailed to the cross through the wrists and then he was either nailed with one nail through the feet or required to rest his feet upon a blade. The way that the body hangs from the cross constricts the lungs and makes breathing very difficult and so (because they&#x27;re [[Bastards bastards]]) they would allow you to push yourself up, and breath and prolong your life&#x2F;suffering,  but destroy your feet and cause you more pain.

Finally, and this is where it can go PearShaped, a spear was punged through his side. The thing is this is given as a proof that Jesus did in fact die because when the spear pierced his side  blood and water flowed out. If this is true then Jesus did not suffer the spear through his side and so how can it be considered part of the [[Stigmata stigmata]]?

Also a pretty good film ([[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0145531&#x2F; IMDB Page]]), ruined only by the fact that most people don&#x27;t get to see the (superior) directors&#x27; cut ending. [[ContentiousFilms See other contentious films]].</script>
