    <a href="/ChezGeek" class="internal">ChezGeek</a> is a card game by <a href="/SteveJacksonGames" class="internal">SteveJacksonGames</a> after which <a href="/GeekNight" class="internal">GeekNight</a> (a board/card games night at <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">Dan</a> and <a href="/ClaireMelton" class="internal">Claire</a>&#39;s place) is named, which uses a special deck of cards including:<ul></li><li> Jobs, such as &quot;Corporate Drone&quot;, &quot;<a href="/FastFoodCateringAssistant" class="internal">Lord Of The Fries</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/PizzaDeliveryDriver" class="internal">Pizza Delivery Driver</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/WebDesigner" class="broken internal">Web Designer</a>&quot;</li><li> Things, some of which are in turn subcategorised into Food, Weed, <a href="/Cigarettes" class="internal">Cigarettes</a>, Booze, etc. It is possible for a Thing to inhabit two categories (for example, <a href="/HashBrownies" class="internal">HashBrownies</a> are both Food and Weed).</li><li> <a href="/SomePeople" class="internal">People</a>, some of which are good (e.g. &quot;The Shopper&quot;, &quot;Mr. Enthusiastic&quot;, &quot;Nookie Monster&quot;), and some of which are not (e.g. &quot;Death Of The Party&quot;, &quot;The Whiner&quot;, &quot;Clumsy Drunk&quot;). Some of these are subcategorised as Cat and Dog cards.</li><li> Activities, some of which are subcategorised into <a href="/Sex" class="internal">Nookie</a>, Sleep, TV, etc.</li><li> &quot;Whenever&quot; cards, which can usually be played at any time, even when it&#39;s not your turn. Some of these are designed to help you (e.g. increasing you income, like &quot;Change In Couch&quot;), whereas others are designed to make life difficult for other players (e.g. &quot;Moron With Chainsaw&quot;, which prevents the successful playing of a Sleep [Activity] card).</li></ul>The aim of the game is to earn a particular &#39;score&#39; of &quot;Slack Points&quot;, by eating, sleeping, taking drugs, drinking, getting <a href="/Sex" class="internal">nookie</a>, etc. Various special rules add flavour to the game, such as the rule that when somebody gets &quot;<a href="/NoisyNookie" class="internal">NoisyNookie</a>&quot; (<a href="/Sex" class="internal">Nookie</a> worth 5 or more &quot;Slack Points&quot;, those people in the rooms next door to them (adjacant to them at the table) each lose one Sleep card that they already have in play... and that TV cards can be played as Whenever cards in order to cancel any Activity (&quot;No, you&#39;re not Going To Concert, you&#39;re staying at home and watching Hitler Science Theatre 2000&quot;).<br />
Several house rules have come up at <a href="/GeekNight" class="internal">GeekNight</a> - these include:<ul></li><li> Every time you play a card that cancels sleep (for example, &quot;Party Next Door&quot;) you must make the appropriate sound effects (e.g. &quot;Whumpa! Whumpa! Whumpa! Whumpa!&quot;).</li><li> A selection of personalised extra cards, including &quot;<a href="/LizHague" class="internal">Liz</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/KitLane" class="internal">Kit</a>&quot; (Person cards) and &quot;Cornetto&quot; (a special Food card, and a reference to this film <a href="/ShaunOfTheDead" class="internal">ShaunOfTheDead</a>, which can be played when <em>another</em> player goes shopping).</li></ul>There are several add-on packs for <a href="/ChezGeek" class="internal">ChezGeek</a>, including <a href="/ChezGreek" class="internal">ChezGreek</a>, <a href="/ChezGrunt" class="internal">ChezGrunt</a>, and <a href="/ChezGoth" class="internal">ChezGoth</a>.<hr />See also: <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/chezgeek/" class="broken external">Official Chez Geek web site</a><br />
