      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">WatchingPaintDry was a beautiful ballad about loss and pain, which reached number one for GenericIndieGroup.

Some people condemned it, and the line &#x27;Watching paint dry, and my elbow ran out&#x27; sparked rumours that it was written by [[Igneous]], a famous chat-bot, but to the true music conossieur, the sublimeness of the final line transcends all that:

&#x2F;&#x2F;I need to know if you were right, so I&#x27;m watching paint dry, to see if it really is more interesting than me.&#x2F;&#x2F;

GenericIndieGroup split up soon after the song was released. Their front-man sobbed openly as he told the press:

&quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;We just knew we&#x27;d never write anything so beautiful again.&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;
