    <a href="/WatchingPaintDry" class="internal">WatchingPaintDry</a> was a beautiful ballad about loss and pain, which reached number one for <a href="/GenericIndieGroup" class="internal">GenericIndieGroup</a>.<br />
Some people condemned it, and the line &#39;Watching paint dry, and my elbow ran out&#39; sparked rumours that it was written by <a href="/Igneous" class="internal">Igneous</a>, a famous chat-bot, but to the true music conossieur, the sublimeness of the final line transcends all that:<br />
<em>I need to know if you were right, so I&#39;m watching paint dry, to see if it really is more interesting than me.</em><br />
<a href="/GenericIndieGroup" class="internal">GenericIndieGroup</a> split up soon after the song was released. Their front-man sobbed openly as he told the press:<br />
&quot;<em>We just knew we&#39;d never write anything so beautiful again.</em>&quot;<hr />&#39;&#39;This page is <a href="/TotalBollocks" class="internal">TotalBollocks</a>. Any resemblance to any song, living or dull, is purely parodic.&#39;&#39;<hr /><a href="/CategorySongs" class="internal">CategorySongs</a>
