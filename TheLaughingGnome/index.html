    The kind of record that could ruin your career if you&#39;re not careful. Catchy, but releasing it as a single was a terrible mistake as it doesn&#39;t represent his (<a href="/DavidBowie" class="internal">DavidBowie</a>) typical style of music. (It was only released as a single after he found fame with his later career, it was not a single when he was doing the &#39;David Bowie&#39; album stuff. Hence the sleeve usually, misleadingly featuring a picture of Ziggy Stardust)<br />
Features a mostly <a href="/CallResponse" class="internal">CallResponse</a> duet between <a href="/DavidBowie" class="internal">Bowie</a> and a high-pitched chuckling gnome (also Bowie) who lives in his house and makes him a fortune by writing &quot;comedy prose for radio shows&quot;<br />
<a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">PaulMann</a> owns this on <a href="/45s" class="broken internal">45 vinyl</a> and is not ashamed<br />
