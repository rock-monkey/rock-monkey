      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">The kind of record that could ruin your career if you&#x27;re not careful. Catchy, but releasing it as a single was a terrible mistake as it doesn&#x27;t represent his (DavidBowie) typical style of music. (It was only released as a single after he found fame with his later career, it was not a single when he was doing the &#x27;David Bowie&#x27; album stuff. Hence the sleeve usually, misleadingly featuring a picture of Ziggy Stardust)

Features a mostly CallResponse duet between [[DavidBowie Bowie]] and a high-pitched chuckling gnome (also Bowie) who lives in his house and makes him a fortune by writing &quot;comedy prose for radio shows&quot;

PaulMann owns this on [[45s 45 vinyl]] and is not ashamed
