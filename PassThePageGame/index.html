Remember in School when you used to get a piece of paper and fold it over and then you&#x27;d each write a piece of a story, without seeing what the person before you had written? 
It always ended up being a story about Uncle Jim and Aunt Jemima having sex with a turkey in space while being shot at by a cowboy...

This is just like that, but using futuristic technology!

I couldn&#x27;t think of a name for it so I&#x27;ve called it &#x27;Pass the Page&#x27;

How we do it:

**[[PassThePageOne Click here]]** to find the first page of the first &#x27;Pass the Page&#x27; (the idea is we can do some more. You&#x27;ll find a list of the parts of the story. Go to the first one that is as-yet-unwritten and add your bit of the story (only do one page, leave some for everyone else). Then read&#x2F;write-protect it. When all the pages are complete everyone can unprotect the pages (or Dan can make a program that&#x27;ll do it for us) and we can read the completed story! 

Another fantstic use of the [[internet]].
