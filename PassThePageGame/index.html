    <h3>Pass the Page</h3>Remember in School when you used to get a piece of paper and fold it over and then you&#39;d each write a piece of a story, without seeing what the person before you had written? <br />
It always ended up being a story about Uncle Jim and Aunt Jemima having sex with a turkey in space while being shot at by a cowboy...<br />
This is just like that, but using futuristic technology!<br />
I couldn&#39;t think of a name for it so I&#39;ve called it &#39;Pass the Page&#39;<br />
How we do it:<br />
<strong><a href="/PassThePageOne" class="internal">Click here</a></strong> to find the first page of the first &#39;Pass the Page&#39; (the idea is we can do some more. You&#39;ll find a list of the parts of the story. Go to the first one that is as-yet-unwritten and add your bit of the story (only do one page, leave some for everyone else). Then read/write-protect it. When all the pages are complete everyone can unprotect the pages (or Dan can make a program that&#39;ll do it for us) and we can read the completed story! <br />
Another fantstic use of the <a href="/InterNet" class="auto-fixed internal">internet</a>.<br />
