Inspired by the BoltonEveningNews&#x27; front page coverage of the death of his friend&#x27;s sister. A  childhood migraine sufferer who died inexplicably in her sleep whilst at university. She was 20 years old. The story was covered in a typically hack style without the consent or contribution of her mother.
