    <a href="/AdamsGrammarSchool" class="internal">AdamsGrammarSchool</a>, or <a href="/AdamsGrammarSchool" class="internal">AGS</a>, as it is also known, is the place <a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> was taught stuff from 1996-2003. Mostly he learned things like &quot;maroon blazers don&#39;t do you any favours of buses full of people who hate you for the uniform,&quot; giving him a paranoid streak that&#39;s still not faded.<br />
The Big School building was constructed in 1656, and is listed as being Grade II. <a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> <em>did not know this</em> when he carved his initials into the stonework, and has had to promise the bursar he&#39;ll give money to the appeal fund when he is <a href="/RichAndFamous" class="broken internal">RichAndFamous</a>.<br />
<a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> believes that, as schools go, it&#39;s a pretty sodding good one, to judge by what other people say of their school lives. <hr />See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%27_Grammar_School" class="broken external">Wikipedia entry for AGS</a>
