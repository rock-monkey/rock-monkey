      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">AdamsGrammarSchool, or [[AdamsGrammarSchool AGS]], as it is also known, is the place MisterJTA was taught stuff from 1996-2003. Mostly he learned things like &quot;maroon blazers don&#x27;t do you any favours of buses full of people who hate you for the uniform,&quot; giving him a paranoid streak that&#x27;s still not faded.

The Big School building was constructed in 1656, and is listed as being Grade II. MisterJTA &#x2F;&#x2F;did not know this&#x2F;&#x2F; when he carved his initials into the stonework, and has had to promise the bursar he&#x27;ll give money to the appeal fund when he is RichAndFamous.

MisterJTA believes that, as schools go, it&#x27;s a pretty sodding good one, to judge by what other people say of their school lives.
