[[Zork]] is a great InteractiveFiction (a.k.a. text-based adventure) game made by Marc Blank and David Lebling and distributed in the late seventies by [[Infocom]], who were - at the time - the world&#x27;s biggest distributer of InteractiveFiction games. It comes in three parts ([[Zork]] I, [[Zork]] II, and [[Zork]] III), and features several awful puzzles (such as the &quot;diamond floor&quot; room, the carousel, and the loud room), and several mazes in the confusing style that was traditional for adventure games of it&#x27;s age. It invented the [[Grue]], which would eat the adventurer if they spent too long wandering around in the dark, and this character was later parodied in many other adventure games, including by the modern [[Zork]] games. It&#x27;s not possible to call yourself a serious InteractiveFiction player without ever having played [[Zork]].

It&#x27;s now free to download: [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csd.uwo.ca&#x2F;Infocom&#x2F;download.html get it here]].
----
Following the success of the original [[Zork]] trilogy, the series was extended (in both directions) in later years, with games like ZorkNemesis, BeyondZork, [[ZorkGrandInquisitor Zork: Grand Inquisitor]], ZorkQuest and [[ZorkQuest2 ZorkQuest II], ZorkZero, [[Sorcerer]], the [[Enchanter]] series, [[Spellbreaker]], SpiritWrak, [[ZorkTheUndiscoveredUnderground Zork: The Undiscovered Underground]], ReturnToZork, [[Wishbringer]], and [[Balances]]. Not to mention the stuff contained in the NewZorkTimes. The entire genre has been parodied by games such as [[Dork]].
