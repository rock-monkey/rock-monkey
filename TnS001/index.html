For once, you&#x27;re sleeping soundly. You went to bed exhausted after finishing varnishing the door (Tootie, of course, couldn&#x27;t help because the varnish made him light-headed). You&#x27;re having a fabulous dream about a big, strong, blond squirrel who sweeps you off your feet and takes you to live in a huge forest.

Just as Blondie is twining flowers into your tail and promising to love you forever, you&#x27;re woken abruptly by the Periloscope making its mad buzzing noise in the corner of the room. You try to go and check it, but realise that Tootie is sitting on your tail and babbling about salt.

Brushing him aside, you drop lightly onto your paws and rush across the room. You look at the periloscope. Inside, a smalll swarm of bees are buzzing angrily against the glass. You check the pollen analysis, and discover that they have come from somewhere to the West, from the Land of the Happy Elves. You shudder. That place is creepy...

However, a super-squirrel&#x27;s gotta do what a super squirrel&#x27;s gotta do. Calling to Tootie, you pull on your red rubber mask and boots and head for the Squirrel-mobile.
