    &quot;From a distance it could be a large lizard, two metres from snout to tail, and coloured a mottled sandy-brown. Those innocent or foolish adventurers who want to get closer will notice that the creature&#39;s head is rather bird-like and is tilted from to side to side as it tentatively sniffs the air. For one brief moment, they may take in the fact that its eyes are large and yellow, almost like a frog&#39;s, before the gaze of the Basilisk turns them to stone.<br />
These legendary beasts kill by catching the gaze of their victim and petrifying them. An opponent needs to [be extremely lucky] in order to cover his eyes in time and avert his gaze. Attacking the creature by slashing a weapon at it without looking is just as perilous, for its poisonous breath will kill instantly! However, a Basilisk&#39;s gaze is as harmful to itself as it is to other living things. Should it catch sight of its eyes in a mirror or some other reflective device, it will turn itself to stone, hardening from living flesh to dead rock in an instant<br />
Habitat: Deserts, plains, ruins&quot;<br />
