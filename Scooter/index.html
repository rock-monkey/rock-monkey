      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Three-piece German EuroDance group fronted by one H.P. Baxxter

The two backing DJs have changed twice in the fifteen years or so they&#x27;ve been around

H.P. Is insane.

Lyrics consist mostly of references to either themselves, DJs, clubs or [[TheKLF]]

Eg:

&quot;Respect to the Man in the Ice-cream van&quot; (Weekend)
&quot;I Want to see your hands up&quot; (Hands up)
&quot;I got some lyrics for you....&quot; (Call Me Manana (live))
&quot;The Painted Cow&quot; (Nessaja)

Recommended listening - Call Me Manana, How Much is the Fish, Ramp (The Logical Song), Weekend and The Night</script>
