Sounds pretty cool, huh? Well... not entirely.

If you got to this result because you chose to [[Chess002 read a book of some sort]] then you&#x27;re someone who is quiet, patient, analytical and willing to perservere to the end. So, quite dull, then.

On the other hand, you could&#x27;ve got here by [[Chess004 watching the TV]] which shows that you&#x27;re basically lazy, but interested in what&#x27;s going on around you. You&#x27;re not entirely bright enough to make connections between what&#x27;s going on and possible threats to yourself, however. Which is why your Queen is running the country, and everybody&#x27;s laughing at you behind your back.

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
