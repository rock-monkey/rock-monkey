    <strong>You are:</strong><br />
<strong><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;a king!&quot;})</div></strong><br />
Sounds pretty cool, huh? Well... not entirely.<br />
If you got to this result because you chose to <a href="/Chess002" class="internal">read a book of some sort</a> then you&#39;re someone who is quiet, patient, analytical and willing to perservere to the end. So, quite dull, then.<br />
On the other hand, you could&#39;ve got here by <a href="/Chess004" class="internal">watching the TV</a> which shows that you&#39;re basically lazy, but interested in what&#39;s going on around you. You&#39;re not entirely bright enough to make connections between what&#39;s going on and possible threats to yourself, however. Which is why your Queen is running the country, and everybody&#39;s laughing at you behind your back.<hr />Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#39;personality&#39; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.<br />
