It seems like an ordinary enough morning when you first open your eyes. Sweetie is sleeping peacfully by your side, and the wood is tranquil. You dig out some acorns for breakfast; there&#x27;s no salt, so you go back and wake Sweetie.

&quot;We&#x27;re out of salt.&quot; 
She grunts something and goes back to sleep.
&quot;C&#x27;mon Sweetie, I want my breakfast&quot;. You shake her.

Suddenly, there&#x27; s a loud noise. Sweetie jerks awake and sits up.
&quot;What was that?&quot;, she asks, as if it&#x27;s in any way relevant.
&quot;I know what it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; You wittily reply, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t some salt, because we&#x27;ve run out.&quot;
&quot;Oh, shut up.&quot; She tells you, and scampers over to the Periloscope. Her harsh words offend you, and you sulk for a bit, until she hits you with her tail and calls out excitedly:
&quot;We&#x27;ve got a call! Somewhere over to the West!&quot;

&quot;Will there be salt there?&quot; You call back, but she&#x27;s already pulling on her rubber mask and doesn&#x27;t seem to hear you. You sigh, and go to put on your own costume. It&#x27;s not easy being a super-hero when you haven&#x27;t had breakfast yet.
