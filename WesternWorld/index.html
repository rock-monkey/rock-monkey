  <section>
    Techinically speaking the world doesn&#39;t have a &quot;west&quot; bit to it- there is no west pole, you just keep on going round and round. The term dates back to when the <a href="/European" class="broken internal">European</a> nations were expanding ever outwards, and they still thought the world was flat, with them at the western-most edge, and <a href="/Asia" class="broken internal">Asia</a> towards the eastern-most edge. With the discovery of the <a href="/America" class="internal">Americas</a>, the <a href="/European" class="broken internal">European</a> explorers and wise men decided the world was in fact round, but the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; were so engrained into people&#39;s minds that they stayed there, and we still use them today.<br />
When people say &quot;the <a href="/WesternWorld" class="internal">Western World </a>&quot; they tend to mean the rich part of it. Although <a href="/Africa" class="broken internal">Africa</a> and <a href="/CentralAmerica" class="broken internal">Central </a> and <a href="/SouthernAmerica" class="broken internal">Southern</a> <a href="/America" class="internal">America</a> are in the west, people most often group them into the &quot;developing countries&quot; camp.<hr /><a href="/CategoryPlaces" class="internal">CategoryPlaces</a>
