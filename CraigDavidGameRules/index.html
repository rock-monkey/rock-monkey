===The Rules===

==What names are allowed?==

You are only allowed to use the names of [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockmonkey.org.uk&#x2F;CategoryFamousPeople FamousPeople]]. For example [[AndyRegan AndrewRegan]] is a suitable name (Regan being a girl&#x27;s name) but he is not famous enough. [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockmonkey.org.uk&#x2F;CategoryFamousPeople FamousPeople]] can include, pop stars, footballers, TV&#x2F;Film stars, writers, scientists... basically use your common sense.

As an example LukeTaylor of [[Aberystwyth]] band TheHotPuppies is not allowed, whereas StuartDavid, former bassist of chart act BelleAndSebastian is.

You cannot have MacSomethings, O&#x27;Somethings, SomethingSons or first names with an S on the end i.e. JulieAndrews - unless they can also be used as first names. i.e. HarrisonFord justifies GeorgeHarrison.

The name has to be spelled exactly - so you can&#x27;t justify AinsleyHarriot because Harriet is a first name.

Pseudonyms&#x2F;noms de plume&#x2F;stage names are allowed - for example BobDylan. You can also use them to justify other choices. You can also use the real names of people who use pseudonyms - meaning you can have both EltonJohn and RegDwight.

You can&#x27;t use people who are known by only one name. So for example you can&#x27;t justify NeilMorrissey by referring to [[Morrissey]] from TheSmiths, cos his name is StephenMorrissey.

You can&#x27;t have BoyGeorge. You just can&#x27;t.

Fictional Characters are **not** allowed. So no ClarkKent.

If you pick a name with a potentially contentious surname - for example ChrisRock, you may wish to justify it by referring to another famous person in brackets afterwards - for example RockHudson. 

You cannot use a fictional character to justify a choice. For example you cannot use FoxMulder to justify MichaelJFox. 

Anyone can ask any other player to jusitfy a choice, if they feel the person is making the name up, or that the surname is not a real first name, by putting &#x27;justify?&#x27; next to it. They should then deduct a point for that name until it is justified. If it isn&#x27;t justified the person loses the point and the name is removed. RestlessBoy&#x27;s decision is final in all disputes.

It is best to pre-emptively justify names by putting:

ChrisRock (RockHudson)- comedian (RestlessBoy)

You don&#x27;t have to justify every name. If it&#x27;s obviously a potential first name then it&#x27;s fine.

==Scoring==

If you want to play for points then put your name next to all names you add to the list. Add up your own points and add them to the [[CraigDavidGameScores Scores Page]]. If you cheat we&#x27;ll catch you.

You get 1 point for every name you add to the list. If you are the first person to think of a given surname then you get 3 points. If you think of a famous person with a double-barrelled surname where all three names are first names then you get 10 points.

The game goes on forever so there will be no ultimate winner. The aim is to have the most points at any given time.

==The Unenforcable Rule==

Just use your brain to think of names. Don&#x27;t just type something into the imdb and list everyone who comes up. This is cheating, there&#x27;s no way of proving you did it but it&#x27;s still cheating.
