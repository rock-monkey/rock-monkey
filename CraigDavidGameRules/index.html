    <h3>The <a href="/CraigDavidGame" class="internal">CraigDavidGame</a></h3><h4>The Rules</h4><h5>What names are allowed?</h5>You are only allowed to use the names of <a href="http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/CategoryFamousPeople" class="broken external">FamousPeople</a>. For example <a href="/AndyRegan" class="internal">AndrewRegan</a> is a suitable name (Regan being a girl&#39;s name) but he is not famous enough. <a href="http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/CategoryFamousPeople" class="broken external">FamousPeople</a> can include, pop stars, footballers, TV/Film stars, writers, scientists... basically use your common sense.<br />
As an example <a href="/LukeTaylor" class="broken internal">LukeTaylor</a> of <a href="/Aberystwyth" class="internal">Aberystwyth</a> band <a href="/TheHotPuppies" class="internal">TheHotPuppies</a> is not allowed, whereas <a href="/StuartDavid" class="broken internal">StuartDavid</a>, former bassist of chart act <a href="/BelleandSebastian" class="auto-fixed internal">BelleAndSebastian</a> is.<br />
You cannot have <a href="/MacSomethings" class="internal">MacSomethings</a>, O&#39;Somethings, <a href="/SomethingSons" class="internal">SomethingSons</a> or first names with an S on the end i.e. <a href="/JulieAndrews" class="broken internal">JulieAndrews</a> - unless they can also be used as first names. i.e. <a href="/HarrisonFord" class="broken internal">HarrisonFord</a> justifies <a href="/GeorgeHarrison" class="broken internal">GeorgeHarrison</a>.<br />
The name has to be spelled exactly - so you can&#39;t justify <a href="/AinsleyHarriot" class="broken internal">AinsleyHarriot</a> because Harriet is a first name.<br />
Pseudonyms/noms de plume/stage names are allowed - for example <a href="/BobDylan" class="broken internal">BobDylan</a>. You can also use them to justify other choices. You can also use the real names of people who use pseudonyms - meaning you can have both <a href="/EltonJohn" class="broken internal">EltonJohn</a> and <a href="/RegDwight" class="broken internal">RegDwight</a>.<br />
You can&#39;t use people who are known by only one name. So for example you can&#39;t justify <a href="/NeilMorrissey" class="broken internal">NeilMorrissey</a> by referring to <a href="/Morrissey" class="broken internal">Morrissey</a> from <a href="/TheSmiths" class="broken internal">TheSmiths</a>, cos his name is <a href="/StephenMorrissey" class="broken internal">StephenMorrissey</a>.<br />
You can&#39;t have <a href="/BoyGeorge" class="broken internal">BoyGeorge</a>. You just can&#39;t.<br />
Fictional Characters are <strong>not</strong> allowed. So no <a href="/ClarkKent" class="broken internal">ClarkKent</a>.<br />
If you pick a name with a potentially contentious surname - for example <a href="/ChrisRock" class="broken internal">ChrisRock</a>, you may wish to justify it by referring to another famous person in brackets afterwards - for example <a href="/RockHudson" class="broken internal">RockHudson</a>. <br />
You cannot use a fictional character to justify a choice. For example you cannot use <a href="/FoxMulder" class="broken internal">FoxMulder</a> to justify <a href="/MichaelJFox" class="broken internal">MichaelJFox</a>. <br />
Anyone can ask any other player to jusitfy a choice, if they feel the person is making the name up, or that the surname is not a real first name, by putting &#39;justify?&#39; next to it. They should then deduct a point for that name until it is justified. If it isn&#39;t justified the person loses the point and the name is removed. <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>&#39;s decision is final in all disputes.<br />
It is best to pre-emptively justify names by putting:<br />
<a href="/ChrisRock" class="broken internal">ChrisRock</a> (<a href="/RockHudson" class="broken internal">RockHudson</a>)- comedian (<a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a>)<br />
You don&#39;t have to justify every name. If it&#39;s obviously a potential first name then it&#39;s fine.<h5>Scoring</h5>If you want to play for points then put your name next to all names you add to the list. Add up your own points and add them to the <a href="/CraigDavidGameScores" class="internal">Scores Page</a>. If you cheat we&#39;ll catch you.<br />
You get 1 point for every name you add to the list. If you are the first person to think of a given surname then you get 3 points. If you think of a famous person with a double-barrelled surname where all three names are first names then you get 10 points.<br />
The game goes on forever so there will be no ultimate winner. The aim is to have the most points at any given time.<h5>The Unenforcable Rule</h5>Just use your brain to think of names. Don&#39;t just type something into the imdb and list everyone who comes up. This is cheating, there&#39;s no way of proving you did it but it&#39;s still cheating.<hr /><a href="/CategoryGames" class="internal">CategoryGames</a>
