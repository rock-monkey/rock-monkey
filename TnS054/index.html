Your skin-tight lycra outfit doesn&#39;t really leave you with anywhere to hide it, so you put it behind your back.<br />
<br />
The elf pops up behind the stall and dusts himself off. Then he looks at you, and there is something piercing about his gaze that makes you think he&#39;s not such a fool after all. His eyes flicker to the stall and back to you, but he says nothing about the teapot. &quot;Now then, young squirrel. Can I help you?&quot;<hr />What now?<br />
