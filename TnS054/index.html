You can hear the old elf struggling to get up, so you quickly grab the teapot. Your skin-tight lycra outfit doesn&#x27;t really leave you with anywhere to hide it, so you put it behind your back.

{{InvPickup item=&quot;Double-Ended Teapot&quot;}}

The elf pops up behind the stall and dusts himself off. Then he looks at you, and there is something piercing about his gaze that makes you think he&#x27;s not such a fool after all. His eyes flicker to the stall and back to you, but he says nothing about the teapot. &quot;Now then, young squirrel. Can I help you?&quot;

What now?
