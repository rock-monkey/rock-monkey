      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">This page removes the damage done by StattosCheatyPage (no, don&#x27;t click on that, you silly sod).

It allows you to drop all the items that visiting StattosCheatyPage made you pick up without dropping any others.

The only flaw is that anything you had acquired legitimately before going to StattosCheatyPage will now have been taken away from you. But it&#x27;s too late to cry over that, sadly, as all the items have already gone, as you can see:

{{InvDrop item=&quot;MisterJTA&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Tape Recorder&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Chocolate Cake&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Stopped Clock&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;A Terrible Thing To Waste&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Length Of Rope&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Ransom Note&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Blue Paint&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Six Pack Of Lager&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;JonAtkinson&quot;}}
{{InvDrop item=&quot;Expensive Soundcard&quot;}}

The only thing you get to keep is the note saying that you&#x27;ve cheated, which you can carry around as an eternal reminder of your underhandedness.</script>
