      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">DanceMusic was developed by German scientists working in secret during the cold war. It is a curious, early example of the MusicalWeapon, a phenomenon which was to finally find its home in late twentieth century PopMusic.

It was designed to gradually destroy the brain and turn any innocent person hearing it into a mindlessly gyrating idiot; its use was an important step in the German plan to gain the ascendancy. However, the early specimens were leaked and so most people became immune to it before it could be perfected.
