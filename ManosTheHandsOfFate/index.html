<strong>Torgo</strong>: There is no way out of here. It will be dark soon. There is no way out of here.<br />
It&#39;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" class="broken external">IMDB</a> page can be found <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060666/" class="broken external">here</a><br />
Just so you can begin to appreciate quite how awful it is:<ul></li><li> The entire audio track was recorded seperately and then badly <a href="/ADR" class="broken internal">ADRed</a> by just three people</li><li> A lead actress broke her leg during casting and rather than re-cast her role they simply re-wrote the script at the last minute to ensure that she didn&#39;t ever need to stand up or have her legs seen on screen</li><li> The opening quarter hour is a shot of a car driving around a nondescript highway, with bad continuity, because they forgot to put the credits on</li><li> At the premiere, the audience began throwing things at the screen, and the cast and crew had to run to escape the mob</li><li> After the release, the guy playing Torgo committed suicide, although to be fair he was suffering from clinical depression before the film was even made<aside><em>It must be said, that this is the <strong>worst film I have ever seen</strong>. I couldn&#39;t sit through <a href="/BarbWire" class="internal">BarbWire</a>, but <a href="/Fuck" class="internal">fuck</a>... I wouldn&#39;t have been able to sit through this either if I hadn&#39;t got people egging me on and the <a href="/MysteryScienceTheatre" class="internal">MysteryScienceTheatre</a> guys taking the piss out of it so well.</em> - <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a></aside>Manos: The Hands Of Fate is a truly dire film (see <a href="/AwfulFilms" class="internal">AwfulFilms</a> - or don&#39;t).<hr /><a href="/AwfulFilms" class="internal">List of awful films</a></ul>
