**Torgo**: There is no way out of here. It will be dark soon. There is no way out of here.

It&#x27;s [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F; IMDB]] page can be found [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0060666&#x2F; here]]

Just so you can begin to appreciate quite how awful it is:

~- The entire audio track was recorded seperately and then badly [[ADR ADRed]] by just three people
~- A lead actress broke her leg during casting and rather than re-cast her role they simply re-wrote the script at the last minute to ensure that she didn&#x27;t ever need to stand up or have her legs seen on screen
~- The opening quarter hour is a shot of a car driving around a nondescript highway, with bad continuity, because they forgot to put the credits on
~- At the premiere, the audience began throwing things at the screen, and the cast and crew had to run to escape the mob
~- After the release, the guy playing Torgo committed suicide, although to be fair he was suffering from clinical depression before the film was even made
&gt;&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;It must be said, that this is the **worst film I have ever seen**. I couldn&#x27;t sit through BarbWire, but [[Fuck fuck]]... I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to sit through this either if I hadn&#x27;t got people egging me on and the MysteryScienceTheatre guys taking the piss out of it so well.&#x2F;&#x2F; - DanHuntley&gt;&gt;Manos: The Hands Of Fate is a truly dire film (see AwfulFilms - or don&#x27;t).
