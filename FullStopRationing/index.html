Our FullStop supplies grow lower every day - those from less fortunate backgrounds can&#x27;t even gather enough [[FullStop FullStops]] to feed their sentences and allow them to speak in a non-disjointed way Here at RockMonkey we feel quite strongly about this issue, and DanHuntley is leading a campaign to conserve [[FullStop FullStops]] on the RockMonkey web site, in a show of empathy towards less-fortunate punctuators

Please support this campaign - reduce FullStop usage on all the pages within your responsibility and include a link back to this WikiPage to show our unity in this cause - simply put the following code on your website to show that you care, and follow our tips, below, to help reduce your FullStop usage:

== Tips To Reduce FullStop Usage ==

~- Try to write long sentences that cover as many topics as possible before you need to take a break in the flow because there is no shortage of words of any variety and you will use very few more words than you would otherwise but you will save many punctuation marks of all kinds
~- Use other forms of punctuation! Are you aware that other punctuation marks; be they commas, colons, or brackets (which are used to delimit interdependent concepts within a phrase), are in abundance?
~- Use bullet points when presenting lists, and neglect to put [[FullStop FullStops]] at the end
~- Feel free to add your own tips to this page!
