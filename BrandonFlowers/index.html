The song &#x27;Mr Brightside&#x27; is a true story about a girlfriend who cheated on him and broke his heart, but happily he now has a lovely fiance (soon to be killed in a fit of rage by me - KtErrington). It can also be assumed that Mr BrandonFlowers is quite an arrogant man since he wrote the lyrics:

&quot;It&#x27;s not confidential, I&#x27;ve got potential, a rushing around&quot;
&quot;Destiny is calling me&quot;
and
&quot;I wanna shine on in the hearts of man&quot;

But I love him anyway.
