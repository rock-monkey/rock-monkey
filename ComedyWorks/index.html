    Comedy at the university every other tuesday.<br />
Regularly attended by <a href="/MattInTheHat" class="internal">MattInTheHat</a>, <a href="/MrRockmonkey" class="internal">MrRockmonkey</a>, <a href="/MrPlagioclase" class="internal">MrPlagioclase</a> and other comedy loving people.<br />
Formerly attended by folks like <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>, for several years, until it became ludicrously popular and the venue started selling more tickets than they had seats, at which point he stopped going. Comedy&#39;s great, but not having to kill people to get to the bar would be great too. He&#39;d probably start going again if they sold half as many tickets at twice the price.<br />
Occasionally attendees cause the <a href="/HeadLineAct" class="internal">HeadLineAct</a> to cry. This occurs when the <a href="/HeadLineAct" class="internal">HeadLineAct</a> thinks they can be clever as well as funny. This is not advisable if your audience know more than you do on a given subject, such as <a href="/EconomicDevelopment" class="internal">EconomicDevelopment</a>.
