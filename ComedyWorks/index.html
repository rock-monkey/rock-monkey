      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Comedy at the university every other tuesday.

Regularly attended by MattInTheHat, MrRockmonkey, MrPlagioclase and other comedy loving people.

Formerly attended by folks like DanHuntley, for several years, until it became ludicrously popular and the venue started selling more tickets than they had seats, at which point he stopped going. Comedy&#x27;s great, but not having to kill people to get to the bar would be great too. He&#x27;d probably start going again if they sold half as many tickets at twice the price.

Occasionally attendees cause the HeadLineAct to cry. This occurs when the HeadLineAct thinks they can be clever as well as funny. This is not advisable if your audience know more than you do on a given subject, such as EconomicDevelopment.</script>
