These people travel around the world explaining to other people why their religion would win in a fight, or something, meanwhile, people from the place they are visiting are travelling elsewhere, doing the same. The net result is that the only people who actually care about [[Religion religion]] are at any given time at the wrong side of the world in relation to the people who are trying to convert them, and who they are trying to convert, and so [[Missionary missionaries]] will frequently find themselves cooked and eaten by strange tribes in distant places on account of being rather annoying, but really tasty.

Now for a recipe:
----
=== [[Missionary]] Surprise ===
&#x2F;&#x2F;Serves: tribe&#x2F;&#x2F;

&#x2F;&#x2F;Ingredients&#x2F;&#x2F;
One missionary, medium
Carrots to taste

&#x2F;&#x2F;Method&#x2F;&#x2F;
Boil, [[SpitRoast spit-roast]], fry (ouchie), or otherwise cook the missionary. If the missionary has not already been killed, cook alive to preserve flavour and provide entertainment. Serve on a bed of crushed carrot or in a pie.

{{image src=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scatmania.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;missionary.jpg &quot; alt=&quot;Missionary(Position)&quot; class=&quot;right&quot;}} More frequently in our times and area of the world, the word [[Missionary missionary]] is used in reference to the &#x2F;&#x2F;missionary position&#x2F;&#x2F;, as demonstrated here by vegetables.

The [[Missionary missionary]] position is allegedy so-named because adoption of it&#x27;s use was forced upon various indiginous peoples as being acceptable to [[God]] (as opposed to their more [[SexualPositions creative alternatives]]). The first documented use of the word is in 1969.

[[Sex]] of some variety is practiced by a multitude of animals and by some vegetables.
