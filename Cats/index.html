[[Cats]] are widely adored by YoungGirls and OldLadies, who if single must own at least one to qualify for a state pension. 

Their popularity is only equalled by the utter contempt shown by [[Cats]] to their proponents.

[[Cats]] do not play games as [[Dogs]] do, being far too aloof. However they enjoy the following activities:

~- Slaying smaller animals and leaving them on the kitchen floor - [[Cats]] do this knowing it upsets and disgusts people, aware that they will be forgiven as [[Humans]] will attribute it to an attempt to provide sustenance for their beloved family. Inside they are howling with laughter.

~- Exposing their [[Anus Anuses]] - [[Cats]]&#x27; favourite way to show contempt for those who love them is to walk away with their tails high in the air exposing a small pink patch.

Much of the appeal of [[Cats]] comes from the fact that they begin life as [[Kittens]].

[[Cats]] are the arch rivals or [[Dogs]]. [[DogsVsCats The Conflict]]

The collective term for [[Cats]] is a [[Resentment]].
