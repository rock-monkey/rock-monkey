Named after an ancient Greek (or maybe Roman) poetess called <a href="/Lesbia" class="internal">Lesbia</a> (or posibly inhabiting the island of <a href="/Lesbos" class="internal">Lesbos</a>). <em>(Checking facts is not something I go in for)</em> <a href="/Homosexual" class="auto-fixed internal">HomoSexual</a> women.<br />
<a href="/Lesbians" class="internal">Lesbians</a> are famous for making <a href="http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/MediocreFilms" class="broken external">MediocreFilms</a> about themselves having <a href="/Sex" class="internal">Sex</a> with other <a href="/Lesbians" class="internal">Lesbians</a> and then selling them to <a href="/ComputerScientists" class="internal">ComputerScientists</a> and other <a href="/FrustratedTypes" class="internal">people who aren&#39;t getting any</a>.<br />
Not to be confused with <a href="/Lesbeens" class="internal">Lesbeens</a>.<br />

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">i'm pretty sure Lesbia was the subject, not author, of a series of poems by the poet Catullus. She wasn't gay. From memory it's also the latin word for a type of bird.</div><cite><a href="/RestlessBoy">RestlessBoy</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Actually, it was the female Greek poet Sappho, who live on the island of Lesbos and set up an academy to which only girls were allowed access.<br />
<br />
Catullus is the Roman bloke who wrote a few things about lesbians in general, and also the entertaining poem about the &quot;sparrow&quot; what he's caught and is holding in his hand... <br />
<br />
Sappho may or may not have been gay; but she was assumed to be by the romantics, and the like. Logically, all the girls with her were gay too, and, living on the island of Lesbos, were therefore Lesbians.<br />
<br />
Good job she didn't live on Crete, really, innit?</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote></div>
