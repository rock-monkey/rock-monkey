They are ugly, brown-skinned beings, about a metre and a half tall, typically dressed in ragged furs, hides and scraps of armour. [[Goblins]] are evil creatures who delight in enslaving, torturing and killing [[human humans]], [[Dwarfs]] and [[Elves]]. Some still dwell in primitive villages in the wilderness, but most now serve alongside [[Orcs]], [[Ogres]] and [[Trolls]] in the inhuman armies of Chaos. Like most of their cousins they prefer to live underground, away from sunlight which annoys them with its brightness.

[[Goblins]] are typically armed with swords, small axes or throwing-daggers. They also like making cruel traps for unwary creatures to stumble into. These can include deep pits full of poison-tipped spikes, barbed man-traps and a number of other nasty devices. Each tribe of [[Goblins]] will be led by a stronger warrior at the front of any attack.

Marsh [[Goblins]] are similar to common [[Goblins]], but with a few notable differences. They are thinner, with green-tinted, almost scaly skins, and their hands and feet are webbed for swimming. They spend most of their time skulking in the mud and reeds of their swampland homes. Marsh [[Goblins]] like [[human humans]] even less than their land-based relatives do, and they delight, for example, in typing a captive to a board and leaving him for giant leeches to drain slowly of blood...
