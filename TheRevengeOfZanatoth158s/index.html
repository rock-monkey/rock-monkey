You hear the sound of breaking glass and when you open your eyes again you see your homosexual acquaintance Ernest wrapping his legs around Zanatoths neck. Scores of Sailors are lined up outside the window brandishing cutlasses.

&quot;Hello mister Restless,&quot; Ernest lisps faggily &quot;Me and the girls thought you might need a little help in here.&quot;

You breath a sigh of relief. All your trusty sailor friends will help you defeat Zanatoth.
