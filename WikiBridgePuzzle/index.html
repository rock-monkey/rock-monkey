    This game is a <a href="/WikiGames" class="internal">Wiki-based</a> re-interpretation of an old puzzle, by <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>.<hr /><h4>Instructions</h4><a href="/PaulMann" class="internal">Paul</a>, <a href="/AndyKeohane" class="internal">Andy</a>, <a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">JTA</a>, <a href="/SuzChilestone" class="internal">Suz</a>, <a href="/RuthVarley" class="internal">Ruth</a> and <a href="/LizHague" class="internal">Liz</a> all want to cross over the same, narrow bridge at the same time. The boys - Paul, Andy and JTA - want to cross the bridge from left to right. The girls - Suz, Ruth and Liz - want to cross the bridge from right to left. There are spaces for eight people on the bridge, and these six start at the two ends (leaving two empty spaces in the middle).<br />
Clicking on a person will cause them to try to move accross the bridge. The boys will always try to move to the right, and the girls will always try to move to the left. There are two kinds of moves:<ul></li><li> If the space in front of the person moving is <em>unoccupied</em>, the person will slide forwards into that space.</li><li> If the space in front of the person moving is <em>occupied</em> by a member of the opposite sex, the person will try to &quot;leapfrog&quot; over them into an unoccupied space behind them. People cannot leapfrog over people of the same gender, and they cannot leapfrog if there is no free space behind the person they are leap-frogging over.</li></ul>If there is no free space to move to, a person cannot move.<br />
Paul, Andy, JTA, Suz, Ruth and Liz are all very stubborn (especially Paul) and will not take a step backwards along the bridge for any reason (the boys will always only move to the right, and the girls will always only move to the left). For this reason, you must be careful not to put yourself into a position where they all get &#39;stuck&#39;!<br />
You must get everybody accross the bridge.<hr /><h3><center><a href="/WikiBridgePuzzlePAJ00SRL" class="internal">Click Here To Start Puzzle</a></center></h3><hr /><h4>About The Game</h4>This game was developed over the course of a day by <a href="/DanHuntley" class="internal">DanHuntley</a>. Despite efforts to the contrary, it&#39;s possible that wiki pages might not exist that should! If this happens to you (and when you click on a person to cause them to move you find yourself on an &#39;Edit&#39; page), please leave a note on <strong>this</strong> page so that it can be found and corrected (please do <strong>not</strong> define them yourselves as this makes finding them more difficult!).<br />
I&#39;ve just (5th November 2004) added a few more &#39;missing&#39; pages. I apologise again for the problems with this game, but sadly <a href="/MattInTheHat" class="internal">somebody</a> started playing it and &#39;filling in&#39; pages before they were finished, thereby causing dozens of pages to have to be re-done by hand. We&#39;re getting there. The puzzle can now be &#39;solved&#39; by a vast number of routes.<br />
Please feel free to add &quot;flavour&quot; comments to describe the <em>positions// the people on the bridge find themselves in, underneath the pictures. For example, //&quot;Paul rocks the bridge... again...&quot;</em>. Do remember, however, that other players may not have gotten to the same position as you by the same route as you, so make sure your messages make sense alone, not just in succession.<br />
