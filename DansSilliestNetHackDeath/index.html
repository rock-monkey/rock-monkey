    Ava the Wizard had successfully fought his way deep into the <a href="/DungeonsOfDoom" class="internal">DungeonsOfDoom</a>, then back up and down through the <a href="/GnomishMines" class="internal">GnomishMines</a>. It was down in the mines that he ran into trouble...<br />
Surrounded by monsters and badly injured, he began the age-old <a href="/NetHack" class="internal">NetHack</a> strategy of &#39;using everything you&#39;ve got out of blind hope&#39;. Hunting through his inventory, he found a potion of levitation... and a wand of digging! &quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;I&#39;m saved!&quot; He drank the potion, and, floating up the the ceiling, zapped the wand directly upwards, in order to make a hole through which he could escape! But the <a href="/RandomNumberGenerator" class="internal">RNG</a> hated him that day, for directly above him on the floor above was a large stone altar.<br />
His gravestone reads: Ava, the Wizard, Killed by a falling altar.<br />
