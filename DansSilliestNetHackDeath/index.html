Ava the Wizard had successfully fought his way deep into the DungeonsOfDoom, then back up and down through the GnomishMines. It was down in the mines that he ran into trouble...

Surrounded by monsters and badly injured, he began the age-old NetHack strategy of &#x27;using everything you&#x27;ve got out of blind hope&#x27;. Hunting through his inventory, he found a potion of levitation... and a wand of digging! &quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;I&#x27;m saved!&quot; He drank the potion, and, floating up the the ceiling, zapped the wand directly upwards, in order to make a hole through which he could escape! But the [[RandomNumberGenerator RNG]] hated him that day, for directly above him on the floor above was a large stone altar.

His gravestone reads: Ava, the Wizard, Killed by a falling altar.
