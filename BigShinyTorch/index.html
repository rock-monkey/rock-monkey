A BigShinyTorch is a useful accesory to have if you are going for a walk in the dark. Although, to be honest, if you&#x27;re going for a walk in the dark you won&#x27;t be able to tell if it&#x27;s shiny so you might as well have a BigDullTorch. Unless somebody else comes along with a BigShinyTorch and shines it at your BigDullTorch, thus eclipsing you and making you feel like the worthless scum you are. Why on Earth didn&#x27;t you think of that and mke sure you took your BigShinyTorch instead of your BigDullTorch, eh?
