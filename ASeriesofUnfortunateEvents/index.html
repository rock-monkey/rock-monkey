  <section>
    Fiendishly addictive series of childrens books by <a href="/LemonySnicket" class="internal">LemonySnicket</a>. Follows the miserable lives of the <a href="/BaudelaireSiblings" class="internal">BaudelaireSiblings</a> who have been left apparently orphaned by a big fire, the stories continue as they try to escape the clutches of the evil Count Olaf. <br />
Everyone who gets introduced to it is hooked. Except for <a href="/MisterJTA" class="internal">MisterJTA</a> who read three and thought they were a bit repetitive... thereby missing the point where the series takes a turn and gets more involved and interesting. Intelligenter people say they&#39;re much cleverer than <a href="/HarryPotter" class="internal">HarryPotter</a>. <a href="/RestlessBoy" class="internal">RestlessBoy</a> wishes he&#39;d had this when he was a child. Me too (<a href="/AlecR" class="internal">AlecR</a>) what can the significance of the <a href="/SugarBowl" class="internal">SugarBowl</a> be?<br />
Now onto its eleventh book (of 13). Recently adapted as <a href="/ASeriesofUnfortunateEventsTheFilm" class="internal">a film</a> starring <a href="/JimCarrey" class="internal">JimCarrey</a> which was horrendous.<hr /><a href="/CategoryNovels" class="internal">Other pages about books</a><br />

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Er. You could try running a google search for Lemony and see if you can find *his* website. Then you could drop him an e-mail, or something, because I doubt he actually reads RockMonkey...<br />

Just a thought.</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">Er. No, really, go tell Lemony Snicket. Lemony Snicket doesn't live in Aberystwyth, doesn't know any of the people who use RockMonkey.org.uk and almost certainly doesn't even know it exists. <br />
<br />
So he's not going to know how much you appreciate his books unless you work out a way to say you enjoy 'em in such a way - and this is important - in such a way as he *will actually find out*.<br />
<br />
Trust me on this...</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>

Love and hope you'll learn how to recognise a website that has *bugger all* to do with LemonySnicket,<br />

<blockquote class="comment"><div class="body">MMM. Two thoughts occur:<br />

a) Why am I the one looking after these dopes?<br />

b) To quote Major T: &quot;Now you're just taking the *piss*&quot;. Are ye not, ye cheery Aber chappy?<br />
<br />
I say (a) because I'm puzzled by it. I say (b) because I don't think anyone getting onto this site from towy is half as dim as the random yank-like people wandering in from the cold...</div><cite><a href="/MisterJTA">MisterJTA</a></cite></blockquote>
