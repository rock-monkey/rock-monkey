      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Fiendishly addictive series of childrens books by LemonySnicket. Follows the miserable lives of the BaudelaireSiblings who have been left apparently orphaned by a big fire, the stories continue as they try to escape the clutches of the evil Count Olaf. 

Everyone who gets introduced to it is hooked. Except for MisterJTA who read three and thought they were a bit repetitive... thereby missing the point where the series takes a turn and gets more involved and interesting. Intelligenter people say they&#x27;re much cleverer than HarryPotter. RestlessBoy wishes he&#x27;d had this when he was a child. Me too (AlecR) what can the significance of the SugarBowl be?

Now onto its eleventh book (of 13). Recently adapted as [[ASeriesofUnfortunateEventsTheFilm a film]] starring JimCarrey which was horrendous.
