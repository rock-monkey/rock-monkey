&#x27;Walking down this same old street again,
The one where I always went.
But I know now what I didn&#x27;t know then - 
You and me weren&#x27;t meant to be.

But there&#x27;s something between us that just won&#x27;t go
Even though you hurt me so...

&#x2F;&#x2F;When you gave me syphillis,
It cost me fifty pounds.
And when I realised this,
My world turned upside down.

If you can&#x27;t trust a whore,
Who can you trust anymore?
My world became a little more blue
The day I paid for you.&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x27;
