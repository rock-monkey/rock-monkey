It&#x27;s got about as many floors as there are letters in the Greek alphabet, which might explain how come the levels jump from (I think) D to F, without there being an &quot;E&quot; anywhere in between. 

Underneath it is A6, a lecture theatre built in early 1989, with the help of government funding in the hope that some students could shelter there when the USSR dropped the Big One...
