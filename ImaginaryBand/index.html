    <h2>ImaginaryBand</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    A band which may have recorded songs, released records, played gigs, appeared in photographs, or have a website dedicated to them but which does not in the most realist sense... exist. They require at the very least, a name. They should also have an idea behind them. Anything else is a bonus.<br />
Imaginary Bands give you absolute freedom to do whatever you want musically. Or at least talk about doing it. <a href="/BillDrummond" class="internal">BillDrummond</a> has been in many Imanginary Bands.<br />
Examples of imaginary bands: <br />
<a href="/TheStylophonics" class="internal">TheStylophonics</a><br />
<a href="/AllIEverThinkAboutIsDrowning" class="internal">AllIEverThinkAboutIsDrowning</a><br />
<a href="/TheFuckers" class="internal">TheFuckers</a><br />
My personal favourite: <a href="/BitchFruit" class="internal">BitchFruit</a>, wait, they are real.....<br />
