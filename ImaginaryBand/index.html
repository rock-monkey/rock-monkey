      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">A band which may have recorded songs, released records, played gigs, appeared in photographs, or have a website dedicated to them but which does not in the most realist sense... exist. They require at the very least, a name. They should also have an idea behind them. Anything else is a bonus.

Imaginary Bands give you absolute freedom to do whatever you want musically. Or at least talk about doing it. BillDrummond has been in many Imanginary Bands.

Examples of imaginary bands: 

TheStylophonics
AllIEverThinkAboutIsDrowning
TheFuckers

My personal favourite: BitchFruit, wait, they are real.....
