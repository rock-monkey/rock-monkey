This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of <a href="/BillDrummond" class="internal">BillDrummond</a> and <a href="/JimmyCauty" class="internal">JimmyCauty</a> using the moniker <a href="/TheTimelords" class="internal">TheTimelords</a><hr /><strong>1. &quot;Doctorin&#39; The Tardis&quot;</strong><br />
A number one single from 1988, comprising part &quot;Blockbuster&quot; by <a href="/TheSweet" class="broken internal">TheSweet</a>, part &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; by <a href="/GaryGlitter" class="broken internal">GaryGlitter</a> and part <a href="/DrWho" class="internal">DrWho</a> theme<br />
Bill and Jimmy claim the name of the group came shortly after their purchase of an American <a href="/FordGalaxie" class="internal">FordGalaxie</a> police car, which allegedly spoke to them, telling them it&#39;s name was &quot;Ford Timelord&quot; (but is probably a reference to <a href="/DrWho" class="internal">DrWho</a>). This car appears both on the cover of the single and in the video for the song itself<br />
Antics include attempting (unsuccessfully) to persuade <a href="/TheSun" class="broken internal">TheSun</a> to do an interview with the car, claiming it wrote the song (indeed, the car was credited for the single).<br />
B-Side &quot;Gary Joins The TARDIS&quot; is very similar, but with more <a href="/GaryGlitter" class="broken internal">GaryGlitter</a> vocals<br />
Opinion? It largely sucks, but the &quot;minimal mix&quot; is quite pleasant as there are practically no vocals<hr /><strong>2. The Manual</strong><br />
Or &quot;How to have a number one the easy way&quot;, a book by <a href="/BillDrummond" class="internal">BillDrummond</a> which tells you (in step by step instructions) how to have a hit on your hands. This technique was followed by Austrian Eurotrash group Edelweiss, who went on to have a number one record. So there you go<br />
Also released as an Audiobook (but only in German)<hr /><a href="/CategoryBands" class="internal">CategoryBands</a>
