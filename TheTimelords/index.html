This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the moniker TheTimelords

**1. &quot;Doctorin&#x27; The Tardis&quot;**

A number one single from 1988, comprising part &quot;Blockbuster&quot; by TheSweet, part &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; by GaryGlitter and part DrWho theme

Bill and Jimmy claim the name of the group came shortly after their purchase of an American FordGalaxie police car, which allegedly spoke to them, telling them it&#x27;s name was &quot;Ford Timelord&quot; (but is probably a reference to DrWho). This car appears both on the cover of the single and in the video for the song itself

Antics include attempting (unsuccessfully) to persuade TheSun to do an interview with the car, claiming it wrote the song (indeed, the car was credited for the single).

B-Side &quot;Gary Joins The TARDIS&quot; is very similar, but with more GaryGlitter vocals

Opinion? It largely sucks, but the &quot;minimal mix&quot; is quite pleasant as there are practically no vocals
---------------
**2. The Manual**

Or &quot;How to have a number one the easy way&quot;, a book by BillDrummond which tells you (in step by step instructions) how to have a hit on your hands. This technique was followed by Austrian Eurotrash group Edelweiss, who went on to have a number one record. So there you go

Also released as an Audiobook (but only in German)
