ChaosAD is the first year of the Crazee calendar. The Crazee sect was formed in the year ChaosAD (or 2097), when the oil ran out. They reasoned that civilisation was fucked anyway, so they might as well live the hedonistic life. According to the Crazee holy text, the MoronicWord, the world will end in the 2107 (or Chaos10), when the fuse on the big bomb they&#x27;ve built run outs.
