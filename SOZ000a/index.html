    <h3>The Police Station</h3>You enter the station to see Chief Inspector Blancheflower&#39;s face is white and feary. <br />
&quot;Restless, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened. Every goshdarn man on the Police Force has been struck down with a mysterious illness. I&#39;m not feeling so good myself. How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; you say.<br />
&quot;Good. Because I suspect foul play is afoot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I heard about that duck. It can&#39;t be real can it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Never mind the duck. All this mysteriousness smacks of Zanatoth&#39;s doing...&quot;<br />
&quot;But how? I defeated Zanatoth only a month or two ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know and his corspe was coated in plastic and sealed into lead box at the bottom of the sea where it&#39;s guarded by police sharks, with guns. Yet still, I can&#39;t help but wonder...&quot;<br />
The phone rings. Chief Inspector Blancheflower answers it and looks concerned. <br />
&quot;What? That fucking idiot!&quot; he slams the phone down and turns to you. &quot;That was a call from <a href="/PeterHain" class="internal">PeterHain</a>&#39;s office. The <a href="/SceptreOfZanatoth" class="internal">SceptreOfZanatoth</a> has been stolen.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Wasn&#39;t that destroyed.&quot;<br />
&quot;We thought so. It seems our beloved <a href="/SecretaryOfState" class="broken internal">SecretaryOfState</a> was keeping it in his home and using it as a paperweight, the tit.&quot; Chief Inspector Blancheflower suddenly vomits all over his desk. Ugh!<br />
&quot;Restless, you need to find out what&#39;s going on around here. I&#39;m too ill to help. I&#39;m gonna go home and drink Ovaltine. You&#39;re on your own Restless.&quot;<br />
<a href="/SOZ001" class="internal">Start your mission!</a>
