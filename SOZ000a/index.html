You enter the station to see Chief Inspector Blancheflower&#x27;s face is white and feary. 

&quot;Restless, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened. Every goshdarn man on the Police Force has been struck down with a mysterious illness. I&#x27;m not feeling so good myself. How are you feeling?&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m fine,&quot; you say.

&quot;Good. Because I suspect foul play is afoot.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I heard about that duck. It can&#x27;t be real can it?&quot;

&quot;Never mind the duck. All this mysteriousness smacks of Zanatoth&#x27;s doing...&quot;

&quot;But how? I defeated Zanatoth only a month or two ago.&quot;

&quot;I know and his corspe was coated in plastic and sealed into lead box at the bottom of the sea where it&#x27;s guarded by police sharks, with guns. Yet still, I can&#x27;t help but wonder...&quot;

The phone rings. Chief Inspector Blancheflower answers it and looks concerned. 

&quot;What? That fucking idiot!&quot; he slams the phone down and turns to you. &quot;That was a call from PeterHain&#x27;s office. The SceptreOfZanatoth has been stolen.&quot;

&quot;What? Wasn&#x27;t that destroyed.&quot;

&quot;We thought so. It seems our beloved SecretaryOfState was keeping it in his home and using it as a paperweight, the tit.&quot; Chief Inspector Blancheflower suddenly vomits all over his desk. Ugh!

&quot;Restless, you need to find out what&#x27;s going on around here. I&#x27;m too ill to help. I&#x27;m gonna go home and drink Ovaltine. You&#x27;re on your own Restless.&quot;
