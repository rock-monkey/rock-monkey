[[Dogs]] are traditionally regarded as a man&#x27;s best friend. The man&#x27;s name is Steve and he lives in [[Daventry]]. Because most [[Dogs]] are seperated from their best friend they form a loyal attachment to whichever family adpots them.

[[Dogs]] like to play games with their families. These include:-

~- Fetching a stick - A stick is thrown (usually overarm) and the [[Dogs Dog]] then pursues it and retrieves it, only for it to be thrown again. This game is considered cruel outside of the UnitedKingdom and is actually illegal in [[France]].

~- Tugging on a piece of old rope - In which a [[Human]] holds a piece of rope in their hand and the [[Dogs Dog]] attempts to take it from them forcibly using their teeth. Usually if the [[Dogs Dog]] is victorious it will chew the rope for a few minutes before getting bored and going into the [[Garden]] to uproot a shrub.

The collective term for [[Dogs]] is a Silly.

In their early form, [[Dogs]] are known as [[Puppies]].

[[Dogs]] are the arch enemies of [[Cats]]. [[DogsVsCats The Conflict]].
