      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">PositiveCampaigning is where you tell the electorate that voting for you will be good for them, assuming you don&#x27;t break all your promises. 

Unfortunately, all Governments break the promises they made when they actually &#x2F;&#x2F;needed&#x2F;&#x2F; the public, so it is hard to run an [[GeneralElection election]] campaign and use PositiveCampaigning at the same time, because you&#x27;ll break all your promises as soon as you come to power, and you have to invent lots of policies that sound good and - ideally - are somehow supported by facts or statistics.

Because of this, everyone involved in UK politics finds NegativeCampaigning much less effort, and will continue to do so until they lose the election, and blame the other side&#x27;s NegativeCampaigning, and say what a dirty trick it was. [[Wanker Wankers]]
