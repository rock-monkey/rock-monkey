So called because he used to flee in fear whenever anyone attempted to touch or stroke him. Whether he still does is in question.

17th Feb - [[DanHuntley Dan]]: Nope, he&#x27;s still terrified of being stroked.

Actually believes in SantaClaus and the existance of [[Daventry]].

Not so called because he has had a lot of strokes.
