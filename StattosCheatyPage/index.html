If you&#x27;ve visited this page by accident and can&#x27;t stand browsing RockMonkey whilst carrying MisterJTA, then go to StattosUncheatyPage and you will drop all the items. And then don&#x27;t come back here again, muggins.

Fair enough - I was planning to eventually make a WikiGameToolkit &quot;save game&quot; option that would create a page like this for a given user.</script>
