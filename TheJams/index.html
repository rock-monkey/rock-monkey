This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the moniker TheJams
---------------
Appeared in two guises several years apart:

A. The JAMs - Scottish rap
B. The JAMs - Dark electronic
---------------
**1. &quot;What the Fuck Is Going On?&quot;**

Debut album, pulled from the shelves almost straight away due to gratuitous unlicensed sampling (particularly the entire chorus of ABBAs&#x27; &#x27;Dancing Queen&#x27; for &quot;The Queen and I&quot;). So they went to Sweden to talk to ABBA. There is no record of them ever actually *meeting* ABBA, so they burnt most of the records in a farmer&#x27;s field (and received a shotgun blast to the car to show for it) and threw some more in the sea on the ferry during the trip back

The music? Lots of sampling and angry shouty Scottish rapping. Quite funny though

---------------
**2. The JAMs 45 edits**

A sarcastic re-release of &quot;What the Fuck Is Going On?&quot; minus all the samples (with accompanying instructions on how to put them back in yourself)
---------------
**3. &quot;Whitney Joins the JAMs&quot;**

Apparently &quot;Made in Scotland&quot; (according to the record label anyway). Curious sampling of random Whitney records (strangely, there is no record of there being a complaint, so maybe they actually paid this time). Quite catchy. Released as a one-sided records (the other being a test tone)
---------------
**4. &quot;Down Town&quot;**

Samples a song I&#x27;m not familar with, but it&#x27;s good
---------------
**5. &quot;Deep Shit&quot;**

A 500 copy flexi disc accompanied by a comic drawn by Jimmy. Never released because apparently the comic was &quot;crap&quot;. Apparently it does turn up in odd places though

Allegedly re-released as &quot;Deep Shit part 2 and 3 of the illegal remix&quot; during the KLF time. Copies have been seen, but nobody seems to have them. Hmm...
---------------
**6. &quot;Burn the Bastards&quot;**

Don&#x27;t know much about this, other than it was retitled &quot;Burn the Beat&quot; for radio play

The JAMs name was then not used for some time, until they returned with
---------------
**7. &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot;**

A pretty dark electro track. Lyrics consist mostly of reading out names of towns in the north, ending with a sample of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. Supposedly a precursor to the never-released &quot;Black Room&quot; (See TheKLF for more)
