This article is about the music, the stunts and the events of <a href="/BillDrummond" class="internal">BillDrummond</a> and <a href="/JimmyCauty" class="internal">JimmyCauty</a> using the moniker <a href="/TheJams" class="internal">TheJams</a><hr />Appeared in two guises several years apart:<br />
A. The JAMs - Scottish rap<br />
B. The JAMs - Dark electronic<hr /><strong>1. &quot;What the Fuck Is Going On?&quot;</strong><br />
Debut album, pulled from the shelves almost straight away due to gratuitous unlicensed sampling (particularly the entire chorus of ABBAs&#39; &#39;Dancing Queen&#39; for &quot;The Queen and I&quot;). So they went to Sweden to talk to ABBA. There is no record of them ever actually *meeting* ABBA, so they burnt most of the records in a farmer&#39;s field (and received a shotgun blast to the car to show for it) and threw some more in the sea on the ferry during the trip back<br />
The music? Lots of sampling and angry shouty Scottish rapping. Quite funny though<hr /><strong>2. The JAMs 45 edits</strong><br />
A sarcastic re-release of &quot;What the Fuck Is Going On?&quot; minus all the samples (with accompanying instructions on how to put them back in yourself)<hr /><strong>3. &quot;Whitney Joins the JAMs&quot;</strong><br />
Apparently &quot;Made in Scotland&quot; (according to the record label anyway). Curious sampling of random Whitney records (strangely, there is no record of there being a complaint, so maybe they actually paid this time). Quite catchy. Released as a one-sided records (the other being a test tone)<hr /><strong>4. &quot;Down Town&quot;</strong><br />
Samples a song I&#39;m not familar with, but it&#39;s good<hr /><strong>5. &quot;Deep Shit&quot;</strong><br />
A 500 copy flexi disc accompanied by a comic drawn by Jimmy. Never released because apparently the comic was &quot;crap&quot;. Apparently it does turn up in odd places though<br />
Allegedly re-released as &quot;Deep Shit part 2 and 3 of the illegal remix&quot; during the KLF time. Copies have been seen, but nobody seems to have them. Hmm...<hr /><strong>6. &quot;Burn the Bastards&quot;</strong><br />
Don&#39;t know much about this, other than it was retitled &quot;Burn the Beat&quot; for radio play<br />
The JAMs name was then not used for some time, until they returned with<hr /><strong>7. &quot;It&#39;s Grim Up North&quot;</strong><br />
A pretty dark electro track. Lyrics consist mostly of reading out names of towns in the north, ending with a sample of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. Supposedly a precursor to the never-released &quot;Black Room&quot; (See <a href="/TheKLF" class="internal">TheKLF</a> for more)<hr /><a href="/CategoryBands" class="internal">CategoryBands</a>
