      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">Competition held in 1599 between FenlandPolytechnic and the UniversityofOxford during which teams from both institutions pulled Christmas crackers in a bid to find out who was best at it. It was held at FenlandPolytechnic.

The competition, originally intended to be an annual affair, was pulled (if you&#x27;ll pardon the pun) in the year of its inception because creating the crackers and associated gifts for the match bankrupted five OxbridgeColleges.

Notable prizes include:
~-The town now attached to FenlandPolytechnic, known as [[Cambridge]].
~-OliverCromwell, who was to become LordProtector of [[England]] in the farce that was the EnglishCivilWar.</script>
