A man is always in a state of heightened awareness, ready to defend his woman and property from all challengers. However, a man should also be able to relax around his friends, and shouldn&#39;t worry too much about his appearence in social situations. Your attitude should have more of an impact than how you look, so there is no need to follow this chapter to the letter.<br />
In order to discourage any attempts to lower your status from competing males, you need to perfect a stance which will make you seem both threatening, yet relaxed and confident.<br />
It is often said that your body-language is that which says the most about you. A man&#39;s body language shouldn&#39;t <em>say// anything about you, it should //shout</em> about you.<h4>Standing</h4>If standing, you should have your arms folded, and you should be leaning against something. If possible, cross one leg over the other, to give an appearence of relaxation. <br />
If possible, you should never fully face someone who is talking (unless the conversation involves physical threats, interesting conversation, or a lady), but always keep your gaze pointed slightly to the side of your focal point. This will benefits you in two ways; first, it makes the person addressing you think you are uninterested, and hence they will try harder to engage you. This lowers their status in the group, as they&#39;re having to compete to gain you attention; this behaviour reinforces your dominance over everyone around you. Secondly, it lets you increase your field of vision, which may give you that valuable fraction of a second required in the event of an attack, or if a lady walks into the room.<br />
(todo: insert a picture of this stance here)<br />
When standing and talking to a lady, you need to emphasise your strength and virility, without offending her. A simple way to do this is to put both hands in your pockets. This draws her attention to your groin (which is where it should be), and allows you to broaden you shoulders, which subconciously makes her think you have good genetc stock, and so makes you more attractive as a mate.<br />
(todo: insert picture of this here)<h4>Sitting</h4><h3>Chapter Two: Attitude</h3><h3>Chapter Three: Communication</h3><h4>Part 1: Cursing.</h4>When you&#39;re cursing someone of something, don&#39;t hold back. If you string various <a href="/SwearWords" class="internal">SwearWords</a> together, and slowly build their level of profanity - you always end up in one of two possible places. <a href="/Fuck" class="internal">Fuck</a>, or <a href="/Cunt" class="internal">Cunt</a>.<br />
Hence, you need to cut out anything before those. A real man knows what he wants to say, and is confident in his opinions.<br />
Hence:<ul></li><li>&quot;<a href="/Piss" class="internal">Piss</a> off&quot; becomes &quot;<a href="/Fuck" class="internal">Fuck</a> off&quot;.</li><li>&quot;I don&#39;t like you&quot; becomes &quot;You&#39;re a <a href="/Cunt" class="internal">cunt</a>&quot;.</li><li>&quot;I don&#39;t like you, go away&quot; becomes &quot;<a href="/Fuck" class="internal">Fuck</a> off you fucking <a href="/Cunt" class="internal">cunt</a>&quot;.</li></ul>And so on.<h4>Exercises for this section</h4>To become more manly you may also wish to experiment with putting different things in your pocket, eg:<br />
<a href="/PenKnife" class="internal">PenKnife</a>- Manly<br />
Lighter- Manly<br />
<a href="/BigShinyTorch" class="internal">BigShinyTorch</a>- Manly<br />
<a href="/PinkGirlyHankerchief" class="internal">PinkGirlyHankerchief</a>- not manly<br />
Picture of Mummy- not manly<br />
a daisy- not manly<br />
1. Find someone in the street and tell them to &#39;<a href="/Fuck" class="internal">Fuck</a> off&#39;. If they say anything back, shout &#39;<a href="/Cunt" class="internal">Cunt</a>!&#39; at the top of your voice. <br />
2. Start saying &#39;<a href="/Fuck" class="internal">fuck</a>&#39; and &#39;<a href="/Cunt" class="internal">cunt</a>&#39; in your everyday sentances. &quot;Could you make me a fucking bacon sandwich, please?&quot;, or &quot;To Penbryn Halls, Mr Taxi Driver, you <a href="/Cunt" class="internal">cunt</a>&quot;. Mix it up a little. Try &#39;fucking <a href="/Cunt" class="internal">cunt</a>&#39;, or even &#39;cunting <a href="/Fuck" class="internal">fuck</a>&#39;.<h3>Chapter Four: Women</h3><h3>Chapter Five: Food</h3>Being a man doesn&#39;t involve much cooking. <br />
If you&#39;ve read this far, you should be able to either coerce a woman or threaten a man into doing it for you. However, you do need to be the master of two thing; meat and barbecues.<h4>Meat</h4>Good meat is the cornerstone of a manly diet. You need to eat meat at least twice a day, preferable for breakfast and for your evening meal. This way, you&#39;ll never lose the taste for blood that a true man craves.<br />
I won&#39;t go into detail about how to prepare and cook meat, because it&#39;s not my forte. Your woman should deal with these things. However, it is important to remember that a true man will only appreciate good quality meat. While a <a href="/McDonalds" class="broken internal">McDonalds</a> hamburger may take the hunger away for a while, only a real fillet steak, rubbed with pepper and barbecue sauce will truly satisfy a real man.<h4>Barbecue</h4>Whether you&#39;re cooking sausages in a hole in the ground on an open fire, or cooking steak for 50 on a multi-plate outdoor barbecue which needs it&#39;s own forest to power, you need to follow some simple rules.<br />
* Always stay in control. The alpha-male in a given situation is always the one holding the tongs, fighting it out toe-to-toe with the raging heat of the flames. If you&#39;re not that man, you&#39;re a nobody at this meal. <br />
* Don&#39;t let anyone take your position in front of the barbecue from you, no matter what is offered. You may be tempted to leave the flames for a second, to open a beer, to chat to your mates, or even to cool off (poof). Don&#39;t do this. <br />
* Be wary of challengers. As sure as you&#39;ve been basking in the attention of being the primary male, you can be sure that someother guy is just waiting to whip the tongs and apron from you and take your position. Remember, no-one looks at the guy who is slicing the bread.<hr />See also <a href="/JonAtkinson" class="internal">JonAtkinson</a>, <a href="/ManlyMen" class="internal">ManlyMen</a><br />
