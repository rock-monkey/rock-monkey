    Value Added Tax the government forces people to add (in the <a href="/UnitedKingdom" class="internal">UK</a> ) 17.5% to the of the original price of an object someone can buy which it then takes in tax. Funding for the <a href="/EuropeanUnion" class="internal">EuropeanUnion</a> comes from 1.5% (I think) of VAT.<br />
This system is currently being introduced in India but with little success as yet.<br />
Also can anyone explain how/when someone decided that you could randomly tax a product by adding the value you are going to tax to it??
