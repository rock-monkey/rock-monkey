    <strong>You are:</strong><br />
<strong><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;a rook!&quot;})</div></strong><br />
Secure, stubby and ever-so-slightly phallic, your test results have come up with three possible explanations for your getting this result.<br />
1. You cheated. Sod off and <a href="/Chess001" class="internal">take the test properly</a>.<br />
2. You came here because you <a href="/Chess003" class="internal">played cards</a>, making you lively, a bit dependant on luck, rather than your own strength, and needing quite a bit of support, if you&#39;re thinking of doing anything important. But at least you <em>look</em> pretty tough, huh?<br />
3. You <a href="/Chess004" class="internal">watched TV</a>, in a fairly boring sort of way, but you&#39;re far too smug to get involved with the plot of whatever trash you&#39;re watching. Yeah? You think? Well try saying that when the King shifts you right into the firing line and goes off to hide in the corner where you&#39;re stashed your crack, you smug little willy. Tch.<hr />Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#39;personality&#39; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.<br />
