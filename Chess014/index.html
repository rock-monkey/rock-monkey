Secure, stubby and ever-so-slightly phallic, your test results have come up with three possible explanations for your getting this result.

1. You cheated. Sod off and [[Chess001 take the test properly]].

2. You came here because you [[Chess003 played cards]], making you lively, a bit dependant on luck, rather than your own strength, and needing quite a bit of support, if you&#x27;re thinking of doing anything important. But at least you &#x2F;&#x2F;look&#x2F;&#x2F; pretty tough, huh?

3. You [[Chess004 watched TV]], in a fairly boring sort of way, but you&#x27;re far too smug to get involved with the plot of whatever trash you&#x27;re watching. Yeah? You think? Well try saying that when the King shifts you right into the firing line and goes off to hide in the corner where you&#x27;re stashed your crack, you smug little willy. Tch.

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
