    <strong>You are:</strong><br />
<strong><div>UNKNOWN SHORTCODE: colour ({&quot;c&quot;=&gt;&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;text&quot;=&gt;&quot;a queen!&quot;})</div></strong> &lt;snigger&gt;<br />
So what does that actually <em>mean</em>?<br />
Well, if you got here because your choice was to <a href="/Chess003" class="internal">play a card game</a> has shown you as someone lively, self-reliant and needing just a little bit of luck to get by in the world. Which is nice for you, I&#39;m sure.<br />
Alternatively, your personality might show that, from <a href="/Chess004" class="internal">watching the TV</a> you&#39;re often a bit of a lazy stay-at-home who remains interested in current affairs, and can spot a threat to your puppet trophy partner from 6 squares away. Just hope the silly old git don&#39;t suddenly realise he&#39;s not the one running the show...<hr />Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#39;personality&#39; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.<br />
