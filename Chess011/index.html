So what does that actually &#x2F;&#x2F;mean&#x2F;&#x2F;?

Well, if you got here because your choice was to [[Chess003 play a card game]] has shown you as someone lively, self-reliant and needing just a little bit of luck to get by in the world. Which is nice for you, I&#x27;m sure.

Alternatively, your personality might show that, from [[Chess004 watching the TV]] you&#x27;re often a bit of a lazy stay-at-home who remains interested in current affairs, and can spot a threat to your puppet trophy partner from 6 squares away. Just hope the silly old git don&#x27;t suddenly realise he&#x27;s not the one running the show...

Fear not! The best thing about Chess pieces is that their &#x27;personality&#x27; differs depending on the person playing with them. Which is why this is a bit of a lame test, really.
