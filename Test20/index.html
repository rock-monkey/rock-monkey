You are:

===The Lazy * * * *===

&quot;Why do it now if you can do it later?&quot; You have made this your philosophy in life. There are very few things which can tempt you out of bed. But hey, apart from when you have deadlines, you&#x27;re perfectly happy. Good for you.

The thing you get up for in the morning:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;has to be totally unmissable&quot;}}

You are most likely to turn into a demented serial killer if:
{{colour c=&quot;red&quot; text=&quot;you get woken before 10&quot;}}
----
You can post your result [[PersonalityTestResultsPage here]] to show the world. Or keep it to yourself and cry in a corner.</script>
