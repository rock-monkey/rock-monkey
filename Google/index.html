&#x2F;&#x2F;Noun&#x2F;&#x2F; - Popular SearchEngine at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;

&#x2F;&#x2F;Verb&#x2F;&#x2F; - To use the [[Google]] SearchEngine. This new verb is also coming to mean, &quot;to search the web,&quot; in light of [[Google]]&#x27;s popularity. [[Google]] are trying to discourage this, as it could lead to their name becoming a GenericizedTrademark, which would render it&#x27;s copyright unenforcable and give way to, for example, somebody to open a search engine called &quot;Google For It&quot; or &quot;Web Google&quot;.

----

The name &quot;[[Google]]&quot; is an accidental misspelling of the word googol, which was coined in 1938 by MiltonSirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician EdwardKasner, to refer to the number represented by 1 followed by a hundred zeros. [[Google]]&#x27;s use of the term reflects the company&#x27;s mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the Web.

[[Google]] uses an algorithm called PageRank (contrast [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;pigeonrank.html PigeonRank]]), and several other secret criteria, to rank web pages that match a given search string. This can be abused by use of vast numbers of cleverly-crafted hyperlinks - a GoogleBomb - which can result in forcing certain results to appear more relevant in [[Google]] than they perhaps should be. PageRank results in strange UsageStatistics on wiki-based web sites like RockMonkey.

Google not only indexes and caches [[HTMLLanguage HTML]] files but also 13 other file types, including [[PortableDocumentFormat PDF]], [[MicrosoftWord Word]] documents, [[MicrosoftExcel Excel]] spreadsheets and plain text files. Except in the case of text files, the cached version is a conversion to [[HTMLLanguage HTML]], allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file.
