Would you trust this man?

GarethBowker adds: Yes, I would. I&#x27;ve met him a couple of times and you really can&#x27;t fault his conviction to his beliefs - whether you agree with them or not. He&#x27;s probably the most determined person I know of in terms of sticking to their (metaphorical) guns and fighting their corner. (I think you could say exactly the same thing about PopeJohnPaulII, but let&#x27;s not go there - PaulMann) What exactly are you faulting him with? Wearing an old hard disk platter on his head?
