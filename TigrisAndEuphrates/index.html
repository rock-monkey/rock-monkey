      <script type="text/plain" id="raw">TigrisAndEuphrates is an immensely clever tile-laying game by MayfairGames, played on occassion at GeekNight. In it, two to four players attempt to control sectors of the economy in the region between the Tigris and Euphrates river - the cradle of human civilisation - by placing tiles and tokens in order to construct linked territories, and fight with neighbouring territories. Like all great games, the rules are quite simple but there are a great number of different strategies for success.

For a good period of time, TigrisAndEuphrates has ranked at number 2 in the [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boardgamegeek.com&#x2F;rankbrowse.php3 Top Games List]] on [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boardgamegeek.com&#x2F; Board Game Geek]].
